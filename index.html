    <h1>The Dark Skies War</h1>
    <p>The Dark Skies War is a war that changed the way of life for all species around the Fraier continent. The war occurs about 18 years before the present plot. Our story for this war begins after some species undergo their own mini-industrial revolutions. The Reptilians discover waterpower as a form of energy. The Shadefolk were able to construct weak but functional firearms and branched off weaponry of the category.  The Frosts were able to make hundreds of quality-of-life changes to their lifestyle. Others at the time were not doing much, The Zuku, Crystals, and Centipedras all focused on survival in their own ways. During this time was also the peak of the trading industry that all major kingdoms participated in, it was truly the pinnacle of the time. While this was going on, The Shadefolk sent a request to each kingdom proposing a continent-wide peace. Since nothing has really been officially established and no conflicts seemed amiss, all kingdoms accepted. This also gave species the chance to meet with ones that are placed polar opposites from each other, gaining an even friendlier alliance from there it was only a  matter of time before the species would gather. The meeting place was the center of the continent, where a massive stone cylindrical podium was built by earthlings after receiving message of the truce. Everyone eventually meet around the middle. It gave species a chance to talk to each other. 
</br>

</br>
The Reptilians were open arms to anyone, they were as happy and jolly as they could be, offering unique foods, explaining their culture, and having a nice laugh with everyone. The Zuku were also very generous, thousands of gifts were made prior to the day of meeting to give out to any of the other species. There couldn’t have been anyone more peaceful there than the Zuku’s. The Shadefolk on the other hand were very secretive. Almost every warrior was ordered not to go into contact with other species for unknown reasons, so they just made their camp and pursued as introverts. The Centipedras were also very strict about their isolation policies. Given most their species were very pretty females, they have to keep a constant eye out of anything kind of bad behavior from others, but they were not in complete solitude as the queen let them roam in groups. The Crystals were all over the place, their leader let them roam free and told them to be themselves without causing harm or uncomfortable behavior. Some groups were silly and unattached, while others tried to find other species who had the same hobbies as they do. The Frosts were undergoing training regimens while also subbing out groups to go meet with all the species. If there was anybody that was the most organized and respectful about other species, it was them. The meeting event lasted only about 8 hours before the truce was going to commence. 
</br>

</br>
A lot of commotion was occuring throughout all the species camps, but nothing to a major point of trouble. Now we finally reach the truce, where all species reported back to their camps, and all leaders would step forward. Six sets of stairs were built around the podium in the center, each leader walked up a set of stairs. Different things were going through each of their heads as a huge moment was upon them all. The leaders all reached the top, where the deed sat in the center of the podium, waiting to be signed. One at a time, a leader would give their speech, their nation would rally, and they would sign it, but there was a slight pause when it came to the Shadefolk leader. Just as the Shadefolk leader was about ready to sign it, disaster struck at that very moment.
</br>

</br>
Purple clouds formed out of the sky, causing uncanny emotions throughout the continent. At first it left everyone confused, purple clouds were never seen before, and it did not look good. The cloud started channeling electricity through it and then it happened. A huge pink lighting bolt struck the front part of the Shadefolk kingdom as hard as it could. The King: Yaozen was in shambles. Quickly after the strike on the Shadefolk Kingdom, an individual strike of the same capacity struck all of other kingdoms in a circle starting with Reptilians and making its way around, as one was about to hit the Crystals Kingdom though, the heart of the kingdom deflected it and instead, it hit the Zuku’s extra hard, leaving it completely in shambles.
</br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/aEHnNYH.png" width="725" height="455" alt="Your Image">
</br>
But Yaozen still stood there with his claymore loose in his hand, eyes wide, he never thought he would see his kingdom crumble so fast. The fears he had developed through his entire life as King have become a reality, and he couldn’t control his emotions anymore. The one thing he sought to protect and improve was blasted away in an instant, it was something he could not stand for. It would then be at this moment that a war was declared, The Dark Skies War.
</br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/e6kK3Lr.png" width="725" height="455" alt="Your Image">
</br>
Yaozen would immediately place the blame on the Crystals. It was the only logical reason for him since their kingdom seemed immune to the effects of the lightning. So, with that intense thought of anger, he shouted “ALL TROOPS, SEIZE THE DAMNED WHO CAUSED THIS MADNESS, THE CRYSTALS LIVES END HERE!” moments after it was shouted, all hell broke loose. After Shadefolk warriors pushed and shoved through the Centipedras they immediately charged at the Crystals with matched anger of the king. The other species were left speechless but wouldn’t stand by and let this happen. Yaozen was a masterful tactician though, as he had more men ready to fight then every species combined. If anyone was ready for a war it was him. Shadefolk warriors in different quadrants were sent to seize each kingdom and prevent them from interfering with the siege on the Crystals. Yaozen knew others wouldn’t let him pursue his goals, so with the understanding that there is no going back, he took two steps forward instead.
</br>

</br>
The wars duration was immense, it started at the center of the continent and eventually traced back to each species home kingdoms, where Shadefolk were just flooding from everywhere with new advanced weapons beyond any other species comprehension. It was a war of madness and uncertainty. Results soon came in though, as after a single year, the Reptilians put an end to the Shadefolk’s siege on them and emerged somewhat victorious. After 2 years, The Frosts and Centipedras on the other hand faced different ends as they ended up under an agreement of surrender that favored the Shadefolk immensely. The ends of the Zuku’s were quickly met in under a week, no Zuku seemed to make it out alive. Finally for the Crystals, the surprise attack severely hurt their numbers, so their only instinct was to head for the ocean, where they can breathe under water, and no one else can. They retreated successfully with a little more than half their species alive. This endeavor is not one to forget for ages to come.

</br>
Time passed after the seeming end of the war, each species had a chance to regrow, but this time, they did it in solitude. Everyone was so traumatized from the aftermaths that they just didn’t want to deal with anyone with all the chaos that just happend. So, trade was quickly cut off, but evolution of the species didn’t stop. With this, there was no chnace of the species leaving their respective kingdom area, even some policies of some of the kingdoms called it treason if you step outside of kingdom borders. It was an unfortunate event that got cast upon everyone, what was worse is that there was something new brewing. Because about 3 years after the wars end, unforeseen Monsters started appearing randomly, no one could make out what kind of species they were. Naturally the monsters were fended off in each remaining kingdom, except for the Centipedra kingdom, where every one of the Centipedras was forced underground because of the pure mass and strength of the monsters there was unlike any other for some reason. No one dared to question it assuming it was just nature, but something far worse was going to happen. As for the Crystals, 10 years after the wars end they fought their way back to their land and started their life again, completely renovating their home one step at a time and staying positive during the process. But as the years passed since the end of the dark war, Yaozen has been planning his next strike very carefully, from designing new weapons to delving into potion study’s and war machines, because this time, he wasn’t going to let any of the species live peacefully.

    <h1>Species</h1>
    <p> Species are the types of weird creatures found in The Adventures Of Crizion, this is to help people get a better understanding of the species and their habits.
</br>
<p style="color: green;">Reptilian's</p> These are anthropomorphic alligators/crocodiles. The species has not always been the brightest. They tend to use brute force for everything. All in all, they just want to have a good time usually.
</br>
<p style="color: brown;">Zuku's</p> These are people who are trees, skin as bark and such. The species is known for being the Oldest to inhabit the land, known more as a peaceful tribe that just wants to live life on their land.
</br>
<p style="color: purple;">Shadefolk's</p> These are one of the closest species to humans, except their skin is completely pitch black and more sensitive to damage. Like I said, they are the closest to humans, so they have a progressively high evolution rate, being the most advanced of all the species.
</br>
<p style="color: orange;">Centipedra's</p> These are also another close match to humans, except with bug like features and ripe orange skin. The population consists mostly of females opposed to males because of simple nature, they are mostly smart while at the same time harsh with their way of life.
</br>
<p style="color: pink;">Crystal's</p> These are creatures that are made of crystals with a resembling structure of multiple kinds of sea life. These are a freelance species with not many laws and has the most freedom out of any species, everyone gets to express their own interests and desires freely as long as it does not do harm.
</br>
<p style="color: lightblue;">Frost's</p> This is the final close match to humans; they just have blue skin and consider cold temperatures to feel good while extremely hot ones hurt them. Their species also had a regular human-like evolution, they like to build marvelous structures and expand their culture far and wide.
</br>
</br>
Other species are coming soon!

So instead of calling him by his real name Fern, everyone nicknamed him Crazytree. His father, who was the King of the Kingdom, had a pent-up rage from Crazytrees actions as they got worse. Soon he couldn’t take it anymore, since lecturing had no effect, he struck Crazytree.

Time passed and eventually The Dark Skies war came, the Zuku's entire kingdom was up in flames, The King quickly grabbed Crazytree from his seated spot and ran to a secret safety chamber while Arrowite fended off Shadefolk soldiers.

But instead, The King shoved Crazytree in there along with the powerful gem from his staff, the chamber was sealed off and the king went up in flames. After a long slumber that caused him to become mute in the process, he was released by no other than Crizion himself, to which he gave his utmost loyalty to Crizion. Crazytree try’s his best to tend to peaceful tactics, but knows that violence must sometimes be an option with his great power he has. His dream is to restore peace to the world with his buddy Crizion.</p>

She will spend all day perfecting her skills to defend her nation until the day she dies, no matter what. Anya was born very shortly before the dark skies war. She was born into a family of high regards, one where her father was a general of the frost army. When the dark skies war hit, Anya's father came back gravely injured, with one leg completely broken and an arm gravely injured. Something rattled inside Anya's brain, despite being only a baby, it would be an image she never forgets. The image of her injured father would keep reappearing in her head like a mental nightmare, she couldn’t stand to see her father in that state or worse, dead. As Anya grew up, she paid no attention to academics and focused only on combat training. Her designated weapon was a short sword, where she would use it at least 5 hours a day. As she kept growing up, her combat and physique kept improving, but her social skills and family bonds slowly grew apart. Anya would not even bother to make friends in school, any attempt from someone would be shunned, and boys who hit on her would end up with their head in the ground. Her family was concerned about her intense training engagement. At 16, an argument sparked between Anya's family and Anya. Her father got mad enough to the point where he called her a monster. Anya ended that conversation with a slammed door. She made her way to the frontline winter storms of the Frosts land and set up her own bootcamp. This is where she would spend the next 2 years. She has fought off a formidable number of people, even the cruel monster known as Ludicrous, with every new victory, she feels a little of herself dying inside and wonders how life could be different. Anya's dream is to protect her homeland and bring anyone to justice that tries to harm it, and to finally make her father see that she was right.</p>

They had marvelous civilizations that would cycle the outer parts of the Fraier Continent, and no other species knew of their existance. Pelestia was born amongst them. All of her life, she was raised to be a magnificent wound healer, being taught among the best, where there was no room for mistakes. She spent most of her life indoors, unable to use her perfectly good wings to explore the world. While sadden, she embraced her teachings and didn’t question any higher ups. But it wasn’t all bad for her, she made many friends through the path of healing, she didn’t mind not being able to leave at all. But then, The Dark Skies War occurred. With the clouds plagued purple and crackling electricity flowing through them all, it caused a huge electric chain reaction to the entirety of the kingdom. This caused every guardian there to get electrocuted, causing their bodies to evaporate from the span and range of the purple clouds power. After the month that the clouds were purple, they slowly turned grey with time, and the electricity was at a normal pace again at least. Pelestia was the only survivor, she didn’t know how, but she knew that she got blinded from the experience, she would never see again. Because she didn’t know what happened, she thought that everyone had fled from the lightning-fast attack. So, she started to feel her way around the kingdom again to look for any signs of life, but none were there. Her dream is to simply wait for them to come back so she could be together with them again…A dream that will never come true.</p>

She finds peace in making sure everyone is in top condition before taking care of herself. Abigail’s life came with immediate loss to her mother. After a few days of her being born, along with her two brothers beforehand, Abigails mother died of an unknown disease. For the next few years, their father went into a depression that often ended every night with him buying a bottle of liquor. So, the eldest brother took care of the middle brother and Abigail by himself after finding a job. During The Dark Skies war, they remained safe in a bunker, but their dad went missing during the chaos. After the events of the war though, Abigails big brother was able to afford an education for them, and Abigail took full advantage of it. While her middle brother dropped out and later joined Vester’s gang, Abigail stayed in school to pursue her education. She learned that she wanted to go into the medicine field; after doing well in testing, she was given the opportunity. Everything seemed to go smoothly from there, Abigail has developed cures for many diseases over the past 4 years and has treated thousands of wounds effectively. From the hurt warriors during monster attacks too medicines developments for a simple cold, she could do it. She was awarded for her many achievements and his made lifelong friends with Reptilians like Linden who are always on the battlefield getting hurt. Her eldest brother went on to become a great businessman. Abigail could not be happier, saving and protecting the lives of all Reptilians. Abigails dream is to continue to walk down this path and to make her mother proud for when Abigail gets to meet her.</p>

        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Linden is a hearty frontline warrior of the Reptilian Kingdom. He has spent his whole life being a shield for others, ensuring that they will not have to go through any pain as they reach for victory. Linden was born in a litter of unknown Reptilians, no one was sure if the other eggs were brothers and sisters of each other. But after the mess was sorted out. Linden specifically was put into a training program to become a warrior. As he grew up, the training only got more harsh. The program they were in was treated unfairly and was built to push Reptilians beyond their normal limits. For 11 years since he was 5, Linden endured this pain. He made many friends at the training camp, that was the only reason he hasn’t attempted to flee or disobey they grounds, its what kept that fire burning inside of him. But then there came a day where one of his good friends couldn’t keep up with the training regime, Reptilians who couldn’t keep up were whipped abusively. Just as the general was about to slash at Lindens friend, Linden stepped in and took the hit. Everyone around him in the camp stared in silence, no one had ever taken the hits for someone else before. The general didn’t know what to do either, frustrated, he just walked away and ordered everyone to keep going, and so Linden and his friend did. After the training was finished, Linden was promoted to a frontliner, where he would take a big shield out on the battlefield. He absolutely hated the shields design though and went to an engineer for guidance. Together they created the box shield, a compressed shield that when slammed to the ground, it expands, and when its done, can be folded back up and put on his back. Now for a next few years and currently, he protects the frontlines of his comrades and friends from threats around the Reptilian Kingdom. Lindens dream is to continue his pursuit in protection, and he also wishes to be a father someday.</p>

        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Dave is a jolly old fat Reptilian that enjoys his days fishing and drinking away the nights. He always looks out for his family no matter what, even if it means committing multiple unethical acts. The beginning of Daves life was all about fishing. Dave and his brother, who was Crizions dad, were born into a local family fish shop. When he was old enough to learn how, Dave and his brother would fish every single day. Sometimes Dave and his brother got along, sometimes they fought, it was never a dull moment while sitting near the beachside. As they grew older, they started to dabble in their own interests. Dave liked the fishing gig just fine, but his brother wanted to be a warrior for the Reptilian army. Once they both reached adulthood, Dave’s brother went to become the greatest warrior ever, while Dave stayed and pursued the fishing business. Years passed, with it, his father and mother. The fish business was a huge success in the end, in fact it was such a success, Dave got tired of it. He went to sell the business to a Reptilian named Fishstick, and didn’t look back. Now spending the time, he has at local bars drinking with others, he has no regrets, and life was great. That was until The Dark Skies War came to be, while he was called in for defense, no invasion passed beyond the underground chamber, leaving him safe. But the same couldn’t be said for his brother, who took an arrow to the head. Dave couldn’t believe this could happen, he had never experienced a loss like this before. He carried on with his life after, but one day, he heard a bunch of higher ups sullying the legacy of his great brother warrior and let’s just say….we don’t hear from them again. Dave ended up going back to fishing though, remembering the times he had with his brother. Daves new dream is to watch over his brothers son, Crizion, and make sure no one else in the family gets harmed.</p>

        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Pyrana is a body builder Reptilian who emphasizes increasing her bulk over anything else in life. She somehow fits into all kinds of groups with her strong personality and feats, making her a likeable person by all. Pyrana’s life started on farm, plain and simple. Her father was in the farm business for a long time, and it was mostly successful. But as Pyrana’s father grew older, it started to slow. Both her mother and father were hoping for boys to help with the hard labor, but all they could get was one female. Her father and mother was distressed, but at the same time, there was nothing they could do. As Pyrana grew older, she would do more easy weight chores while she would watch her father work himself out. One day, her father broke his back, leaving him unable to do the heavy lifting farm activities. This would be the great moment where Pyrana was done doing her sissy-like chores and started to heavy lift. She started to pump iron religiously until she couldn’t, she would work every muscle until it was sore. She started to lift more weight than her dad currently could and proceeded to quickly pass the most he had ever carried. Her father and mother were truly proud of her feat, but she didn’t stop there. After The Dark Skies War, she took part in many different weightlifting competitions, going from place to place to show off her strength. Soon enough, she became an icon for all female Reptilians out there, making crappy but still motivational speeches and being the face of female strength. Today, she is still bypassing many men who come by her, and her will to pump iron never vanished. Pyrana’s dream is to become the strongest Reptilian in the world, while spreading the word and motivating others at the same time.</p>
