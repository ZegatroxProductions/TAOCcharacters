    <h1>The Dark Skies War</h1>
    <p>The Dark Skies War is a war that changed the way of life for all species around the Fraier continent. The war occurs about 18 years before the present plot. Our story for this war begins after some species undergo their own mini-industrial revolutions. The Reptilians discover waterpower as a form of energy. The Shadefolk were able to construct weak but functional firearms and branched off weaponry of the category.  The Frosts were able to make hundreds of quality-of-life changes to their lifestyle. Others at the time were not doing much, The Zuku, Crystals, and Centipedras all focused on survival in their own ways. During this time was also the peak of the trading industry that all major kingdoms participated in, it was truly the pinnacle of the time. While this was going on, The Shadefolk sent a request to each kingdom proposing a continent-wide peace. Since nothing has really been officially established and no conflicts seemed amiss, all kingdoms accepted. This also gave species the chance to meet with ones that are placed polar opposites from each other, gaining an even friendlier alliance from there it was only a  matter of time before the species would gather. The meeting place was the center of the continent, where a massive stone cylindrical podium was built by earthlings after receiving message of the truce. Everyone eventually meet around the middle. It gave species a chance to talk to each other.

The Reptilians were open arms to anyone, they were as happy and jolly as they could be, offering unique foods, explaining their culture, and having a nice laugh with everyone. The Zuku were also very generous, thousands of gifts were made prior to the day of meeting to give out to any of the other species. There couldn’t have been anyone more peaceful there than the Zuku’s. The Shadefolk on the other hand were very secretive. Almost every warrior was ordered not to go into contact with other species for unknown reasons, so they just made their camp and pursued as introverts. The Centipedras were also very strict about their isolation policies. Given most their species were very pretty females, they have to keep a constant eye out of anything kind of bad behavior from others, but they were not in complete solitude as the queen let them roam in groups. The Crystals were all over the place, their leader let them roam free and told them to be themselves without causing harm or uncomfortable behavior. Some groups were silly and unattached, while others tried to find other species who had the same hobbies as they do. The Frosts were undergoing training regimens while also subbing out groups to go meet with all the species. If there was anybody that was the most organized and respectful about other species, it was them. The meeting event lasted only about 8 hours before the truce was going to commence.

</br>
A lot of commotion was occuring throughout all the species camps, but nothing to a major point of trouble. Now we finally reach the truce, where all species reported back to their camps, and all leaders would step forward. Six sets of stairs were built around the podium in the center, each leader walked up a set of stairs. Different things were going through each of their heads as a huge moment was upon them all. The leaders all reached the top, where the deed sat in the center of the podium, waiting to be signed. One at a time, a leader would give their speech, their nation would rally, and they would sign it, but there was a slight pause when it came to the Shadefolk leader. Just as the Shadefolk leader was about ready to sign it, disaster struck at that very moment.

</br>
Purple clouds formed out of the sky, causing uncanny emotions throughout the continent. At first it left everyone confused, purple clouds were never seen before, and it did not look good. The cloud started channeling electricity through it and then it happened. A huge pink lighting bolt struck the front part of the Shadefolk kingdom as hard as it could. The King: Yaozen was in shambles. Quickly after the strike on the Shadefolk Kingdom, an individual strike of the same capacity struck all of other kingdoms in a circle starting with Reptilians and making its way around, as one was about to hit the Crystals Kingdom though, the heart of the kingdom deflected it and instead, it hit the Zuku’s extra hard, leaving it completely in shambles.
</br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/aEHnNYH.png" width="725" height="455" alt="Your Image">
</br>
But Yaozen still stood there with his claymore loose in his hand, eyes wide, he never thought he would see his kingdom crumble so fast. The fears he had developed through his entire life as King have become a reality, and he couldn’t control his emotions anymore. The one thing he sought to protect and improve was blasted away in an instant, it was something he could not stand for. It would then be at this moment that a war was declared, The Dark Skies War.
</br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/e6kK3Lr.png" width="725" height="455" alt="Your Image">
</br>
Yaozen would immediately place the blame on the Crystals. It was the only logical reason for him since their kingdom seemed immune to the effects of the lightning. So, with that intense thought of anger, he shouted “ALL TROOPS, SEIZE THE DAMNED WHO CAUSED THIS MADNESS, THE CRYSTALS LIVES END HERE!” moments after it was shouted, all hell broke loose. After Shadefolk warriors pushed and shoved through the Centipedras they immediately charged at the Crystals with matched anger of the king. The other species were left speechless but wouldn’t stand by and let this happen. Yaozen was a masterful tactician though, as he had more men ready to fight then every species combined. If anyone was ready for a war it was him. Shadefolk warriors in different quadrants were sent to seize each kingdom and prevent them from interfering with the siege on the Crystals. Yaozen knew others wouldn’t let him pursue his goals, so with the understanding that there is no going back, he took two steps forward instead.
</br>

</br>
The wars duration was immense, it started at the center of the continent and eventually traced back to each species home kingdoms, where Shadefolk were just flooding from everywhere with new advanced weapons beyond any other species comprehension. It was a war of madness and uncertainty. Results soon came in though, as after a single year, the Reptilians put an end to the Shadefolk’s siege on them and emerged somewhat victorious. After 2 years, The Frosts and Centipedras on the other hand faced different ends as they ended up under an agreement of surrender that favored the Shadefolk immensely. The ends of the Zuku’s were quickly met in under a week, no Zuku seemed to make it out alive. Finally for the Crystals, the surprise attack severely hurt their numbers, so their only instinct was to head for the ocean, where they can breathe under water, and no one else can. They retreated successfully with a little more than half their species alive. This endeavor is not one to forget for ages to come.
</br>

</br>
Time passed after the seeming end of the war, each species had a chance to regrow, but this time, they did it in solitude. Everyone was so traumatized from the aftermaths that they just didn’t want to deal with anyone with all the chaos that just happend. So, trade was quickly cut off, but evolution of the species didn’t stop. With this, there was no chnace of the species leaving their respective kingdom area, even some policies of some of the kingdoms called it treason if you step outside of kingdom borders. It was an unfortunate event that got cast upon everyone, what was worse is that there was something new brewing. Because about 3 years after the wars end, unforeseen Monsters started appearing randomly, no one could make out what kind of species they were. Naturally the monsters were fended off in each remaining kingdom, except for the Centipedra kingdom, where every one of the Centipedras was forced underground because of the pure mass and strength of the monsters there was unlike any other for some reason. No one dared to question it assuming it was just nature, but something far worse was going to happen. As for the Crystals, 10 years after the wars end they fought their way back to their land and started their life again, completely renovating their home one step at a time and staying positive during the process. But as the years passed since the end of the dark war, Yaozen has been planning his next strike very carefully, from designing new weapons to delving into potion study’s and war machines, because this time, he wasn’t going to let any of the species live peacefully.

    <h1>Species</h1>
    <p> Species are the types of weird creatures found in The Adventures Of Crizion, this is to help people get a better understanding of the species and their habits.
</br>
<p style="color: green;">Reptilian's</p> These are anthropomorphic alligators/crocodiles. The species has not always been the brightest. They tend to use brute force for everything. All in all, they just want to have a good time usually.
</br>
<p style="color: brown;">Zuku's</p> These are people who are trees, skin as bark and such. The species is known for being the Oldest to inhabit the land, known more as a peaceful tribe that just wants to live life on their land.
</br>
<p style="color: purple;">Shadefolk's</p> These are one of the closest species to humans, except their skin is completely pitch black and more sensitive to damage. Like I said, they are the closest to humans, so they have a progressively high evolution rate, being the most advanced of all the species.
</br>
<p style="color: orange;">Centipedra's</p> These are also another close match to humans, except with bug like features and ripe orange skin. The population consists mostly of females opposed to males because of simple nature, they are mostly smart while at the same time harsh with their way of life.
</br>
<p style="color: pink;">Crystal's</p> These are creatures that are made of crystals with a resembling structure of multiple kinds of sea life. These are a freelance species with not many laws and has the most freedom out of any species, everyone gets to express their own interests and desires freely as long as it does not do harm.
</br>
<p style="color: lightblue;">Frost's</p> This is the final close match to humans; they just have blue skin and consider cold temperatures to feel good while extremely hot ones hurt them. Their species also had a regular human-like evolution, they like to build marvelous structures and expand their culture far and wide.
</br>
</br>
Other species are coming soon!

        <h2>Crizion</h2>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/v8SJNky.png" width="725" height="455" alt="Your Image">
	<p><strong>Species:</strong> Reptilian</p>
        <p><strong>Gender:</strong> Male♂️</p>
        <p><strong>Age:</strong> 18</p>
	<p><strong>Role:</strong> Main Hero</p>
        <p><strong>Birthday:</strong> September 22nd</p>
        <hr>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Crizion is an optimistic Reptilian who always looks on the bright side of things. He will never hesitate to help out friends or family in need. Crizion was born a few days after The Dark Skies War was declared. When his village was under siege, his father, who was an excellent warrior, goes to defend his hometown, after defending it greatly for some time, he eventually met his end as an arrow was struck through his head. As the warriors of the Shadefolk kingdom pushed closer, their home was burnt to the ground with Crizion and his mother in it, while his mother died under the collapse, Crizion lived, who was then quickly saved by an Anonymous Reptilian Warrior and brought to shelter until the war passed. From there, his grandma Pho took Crizion under her wing. Eventually, Crizion had to get a job as a blacksmith to support his grandma who was unable to work after finally retiring from her job. Crizion actually learned to like this job, there was something about sharpening weapons that he couldn’t shake. Crizion makes sure to work hard to make currency by day, and train to be a great warrior at night. He spends every night since his 13th birthday, when he was gifted with a spear, to train with it in every way possible so he can be prepared for anything, he REALLY loved to sharpen it. At age 16, Crizion was heading to work when all of a sudden he wasn’t looking and walked right in front of a royal carriage, causing Crizion to fall to the ground. The prince of the Reptilian Kingdom exited the carriage and started to cuss Crizion out. But Crizion didn’t know what to do, he didn’t know what to say, he’s never stood up to anyone like this before. The prince was fed up with his actions that Crizion didn’t mean to commit and grabbed a whip out of the carriage. Crizions eyes widened as he started to back up on all fours. The prince utter to himself before readying the whip: “This is what happens to Reptilians who don’t fall in line.” And right after, he launched the whip. In that moment, something snapped in Crizion, he gained lightning-fast instinct out of pure rage from that one sentence. He immediately uses this instinct to catch the whip around his hand and throw the royal to the ground. The royal ended up crying and said a mumble of words along the lines of revenge and left. In current day after the events, nothing was done about it and Crizion continued to work at the blacksmiths happily while spending time with his grandma. Crizions dream is to explore the world and make new friends, and to find that spark to make the world a better place!</p>

	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/p27rtqw.jpeg" width="725" height="455" alt="Your Image">
	<p><strong>Species:</strong> Zuku</p>
        <p><strong>Gender:</strong> Male♂️</p>

	<p><strong>Role:</strong> Hero</p>
        <p><strong>Birthday:</strong> October 21st</p>
        <hr>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Crazytree (also known by Fern) is a clueless Zuku that never knows what’s going on. Once he is fixated on something, he will stop paying attention to anything else, but he is also loyal to the very end when it comes to friendships. Crazytree was born about a year before the Dark Skies wars beginning, as he grew up, He was an insane kid that didn’t think too much about his choices, he did what he pleased. So instead of calling him by his real name Fern, everyone nicknamed him Crazytree. His father, who was the King of the Kingdom, had a pent-up rage from Crazytree’s actions as they got worse. Soon he couldn’t take it anymore, since lecturing had no effect, he struck Crazytree. After being struck, Crazytree was put in a state of mind where he did nothing, people thought he was paralyzed and mentally damaged and the King regretted his action the most. Crazytree continued to sit in this state of mind for years to come. It raised concern about the kings royalty position in a kingdom of peace. But in reality, during this dormant time, Crazytree was happy, because he was able to talk with his mother that passed during his birth. Crazytree didn’t know if it was real or not, but he made sure to enjoy every moment of it while he could. Even more time passed and eventually The Dark Skies war came, the Zuku's entire kingdom was up in flames, The King quickly grabbed Crazytree from his seated spot and ran to a secret safety chamber while Arrowite fended off Shadefolk soldiers. The chamber could only hold one person, but was immune to almost anything, it was reserved for the king. But instead, The King shoved Crazytree in there along with the powerful gem from his staff, the chamber was sealed off and the king went up in flames. After a long slumber that caused him to become mute in the process, he was released by no other than Crizion himself, to which he gave his utmost loyalty to Crizion. Crazytree try’s his best to tend to peaceful tactics, but knows that violence must sometimes be an option with the great power he has. His dream is to restore peace to the world with his buddy Crizion.</p>

	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/KZxuJBd.jpeg" width="725" height="455" alt="Your Image">
	<p><strong>Species:</strong> Shadefolk</p>
        <p><strong>Gender:</strong> Male♂️</p>
        <p><strong>Age:</strong> 18</p>
	<p><strong>Role:</strong> Hero</p>
        <p><strong>Birthday:</strong> May 23rd</p>
        <hr>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Bulletblade (also known by Reiss) is a sly and fast Shadefolk that does stuff that only helps himself. With his super-fast speed and reflexes, he can do whatever he pleases, he always steals the show with his massive amounts of jesting. Bulletblade was born into a family of absolute royalty; he is the youngest of the 3 brothers in the royal family. His father: Yaozen, sought a son who could carry the vessel of a dragon. Yaozen got what he wanted instantly as the eldest brother Wuji was gifted , so Reiss and Garvoch were cast aside and paid no attention too. The dark skies war took place, but Bulletblade was safe inside the castle with the strongest defense, so he went unaffected. As time passed from there, he took on the job of a guard. One day, he chased a thief into a valley who had stolen fruits, once he reached the end of the valley is where everything changed for him. He saw hundreds of Shadefolk, starving and with ripped clothes. That was all Reiss needed to see to realize how cruel his father’s methods were. That same day, he confronted his father about it, and they ended up getting into a huge argument, something Reiss said to Yaozen really struck Yaozen’s ego, so Yaozen swung his claymore and Reiss and banished him from the Royal doors. From there, Reiss traveled back to the Valley with the unfortunate in it and offered help, their chief accepted them. From there, Reiss became an astonishing thief, honing his skills to perfection to steal all kinds of necessities without anyone batting an eye. Eventually he was caught on too though and a bounty was put on his head. But that didn’t stop him, the chief of the unfortunate gifted Reiss with fancy cloth that resembled a ninja suit and two katanas, shortly after, Benton gifted him with two pistols crafted by him for helping his family in the unfortunate. Reiss then decided to go by the nickname Bulletblade, and he swore to fight for the unfortunate, since that’s what he wants to do. Bulletblades dream is to correct the mistakes his father made...and to pick up a hot chick to marry along the way.</p>

He will do anything to become the greatest, all while gaining respect from his peers. Tkaragem was born Shortly after the Crystals general awakening from the grand heart. From there, his self-proclaimed leader, Ukara, guided him along with everyone else on a path to find themselves in the world. Tkaragem mostly took interest in competition, he would do simple things like racing others and having hand to hand duals with others. Tkaragem didn’t make many friends this way, but he didn’t care, all he cared about was being the best. Ukara let him explore that interest for a while until almost two years passed, when Ukara would have an important talk with Tkaragem. After the talk led to the events of the Dark Skies war. Since the siege was almost immediate for the crystals with the blame placed on them. Tkaragem and all the other Crystals were caught off guard. Tkaragem was practicing his combat only to suddenly be ambushed by a Shadefolk. Tkaragem was able to handle him with ease, but it didn’t come so easy when he was surrounded. Ukara would then jump in to save the day, using specialized sleep dart crystals from his tail to put them to sleep. Ukara was against the thought of unnatural killing, they believed that this was not an unnatural scenario. Everyone was set to run for the ocean, since they could breathe in water. As Ukara and Tkaragem were about to reach the edge, Tkaragem wasn’t ready to flee, he got out of Ukaras grasp and started beating up more Shadefolk. Ukara stopped him shortly and attempted to pull him. Shortly after, Ukara got impaled. The moment was silent and Tkaragem was shell shocked. Someone else picked up Tkaragem and they went deep into the ocean. Tkaragem then spent the first few years of his life mourning until he was hit with a vision from Ukara.

	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/HUn3TUo.jpeg" width="725" height="455" alt="Your Image">
	<p><strong>Species:</strong> Frost</p>
        <p><strong>Gender:</strong> Female♀️</p>
        <p><strong>Age:</strong> 18</p>
	<p><strong>Role:</strong> Hero</p>
        <p><strong>Birthday:</strong> August 30th</p>
        <hr>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Anya is a stone-cold law-abiding warrior that will stop at nothing to bring people to justice. She will spend all day perfecting her skills to defend her nation until the day she dies, no matter what. Anya was born very shortly before the dark skies war. She was born into a family of high regards, one where her father was a general of the frost army. When the dark skies war hit, Anya's father came back gravely injured, with one leg completely broken and an arm gravely injured. Something rattled inside Anya's brain, despite being only a baby, it would be an image she never forgets. The image of her injured father would keep reappearing in her head like a mental nightmare, she couldn’t stand to see her father in that state or worse, dead. As Anya grew up, she paid no attention to academics and focused only on combat training. Her designated weapon was a short sword, where she would use it at least 5 hours a day. As she kept growing up, her combat and physique kept improving, but her social skills and family bonds slowly grew apart. Anya would not even bother to make friends in school, any attempt from someone would be shunned, and boys who hit on her would end up with their head in the ground. Her family was concerned about her intense training engagement. At 16, an argument sparked between Anya's family and Anya. Her father got mad enough to the point where he called her a monster. Anya ended that conversation with a slammed door. She made her way to the frontline winter storms of the Frosts land and set up her own bootcamp. This is where she would spend the next 2 years. She has fought off a formidable number of people, even the cruel monster known as Ludicrous, with every new victory, she feels a little of herself dying inside and wonders how life could be different. Anya's dream is to protect her homeland and bring anyone to justice that tries to harm it, and to finally make her father see that she was right.</p>

While he cowers in the face of battle, he is highly skilled in making unique and never breaking weapons. Axol was born in the Revendead continent, specifically the Death Valley, which is where he gets his dark red color from. In a place like Death Valley, murder, weapons and fights were everything. Axol was raised to inherit his father’s fighting legacy, but he didn’t want that, Axol was scared of fights, therefore, he ended up getting kicked out of his household at age 15. He then discovered his love for designing weapons. Swords specifically was what he loved to do, any shape or size, Axol was able to do it. Axol then started a business for weapon making and became a great hit, everyone in his local neighborhood would buy weapons from him. The business was going well, until it attracted his fathers attention along with their current monarch. The monarch did not support the freestyle selling of weapons, furious, he challenged Axol to a fight. Just as the monarch was about to blow Axol’s head off, his father stepped in and vowed to fight for him. Axol was confused, but he couldn’t think straight, in the presence of the monarch Axol was coveted in fear. With only a signaling nod from Axol’s father, Axol fled Death Valley, and didn’t look back. After flying for what seemed to be forever, he stumbled upon the Fraier Continent. He then continued to start up and run his business for the next few years. While he is proud of what he has accomplished, Axol’s new dream is to find a way to travel back to Revendead a new and brave dragon to make his father proud.</p>

She is always looking for someone to tend to, she strives to heal people who do good for the world and to make a difference. Pelestia was born amongst the sky’s in the clouds as a part of an ancient species: The Guardians. They had marvelous civilizations that would cycle the outer parts of the Fraier Continent, and no other species knew of their existance. Pelestia was born amongst them. All of her life, she was raised to be a magnificent wound healer, being taught among the best, where there was no room for mistakes. She spent most of her life indoors, unable to use her perfectly good wings to explore the world. While sadden, she embraced her teachings and didn’t question any higher ups. But it wasn’t all bad for her, she made many friends through the path of healing, she didn’t mind not being able to leave at all. But then, The Dark Skies War occurred. With the clouds plagued purple and crackling electricity flowing through them all, it caused a huge electric chain reaction to the entirety of the kingdom. This caused every guardian there to get electrocuted, causing their bodies to evaporate from the span and range of the purple clouds power. After the month that the clouds were purple, they slowly turned grey with time, and the electricity was at a normal pace again at least. Pelestia was the only survivor, she didn’t know how, but she knew that she got blinded from the experience, she would never see again. Because she didn’t know what happened, she thought that everyone had fled from the lightning-fast attack. So, she started to feel her way around the kingdom again to look for any signs of life, but none were there. Her dream is to simply wait for them to come back so she could be together with them again…A dream that will never come true.</p>

        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Linden is a hearty frontline warrior of the Reptilian Kingdom. He has spent his whole life being a shield for others, ensuring that they will not have to go through any pain as they reach for victory. Linden was born in a litter of unknown Reptilians, no one was sure if the other eggs were brothers and sisters of each other. But after the mess was sorted out. Linden specifically was put into a training program to become a warrior. As he grew up, the training only got more harsh. The program they were in was treated unfairly and was built to push Reptilians beyond their normal limits. For 11 years since he was 5, Linden endured this pain. He made many friends at the training camp, that was the only reason he hasn’t attempted to flee or disobey they grounds, its what kept that fire burning inside of him. But then there came a day where one of his good friends couldn’t keep up with the training regime, Reptilians who couldn’t keep up were whipped abusively. Just as the general was about to slash at Lindens friend, Linden stepped in and took the hit. Everyone around him in the camp stared in silence, no one had ever taken the hits for someone else before. The general didn’t know what to do either, frustrated, he just walked away and ordered everyone to keep going, and so Linden and his friend did. After the training was finished, Linden was promoted to a frontliner, where he would take a big shield out on the battlefield. He absolutely hated the shields design though and went to an engineer for guidance. Together they created the box shield, a compressed shield that when slammed to the ground, it expands, and when its done, can be folded back up and put on his back. Now for a next few years and currently, he protects the frontlines of his comrades and friends from threats around the Reptilian Kingdom. Lindens dream is to continue his pursuit in protection, and he also wishes to be a father someday.</p>

He always looks out for his family no matter what, even if it means committing multiple unethical acts. The beginning of Daves life was all about fishing.

Sometimes Dave and his brother got along, sometimes they fought, it was never a dull moment while sitting near the beachside. As they grew older, they started to dabble in their own interests. Dave liked the fishing gig just fine, but his brother wanted to be a warrior for the Reptilian army. Once they both reached adulthood, Dave’s brother went to become the greatest warrior ever, while Dave stayed and pursued the fishing business. Years passed, with it, his father and mother.

Now spending the time, he has at local bars drinking with others, he has no regrets, and life was great. That was until The Dark Skies War came to be, while he was called in for defense, no invasion passed beyond the underground chamber, leaving him safe. But the same couldn’t be said for his brother, who took an arrow to the head. Dave couldn’t believe this could happen, he had never experienced a loss like this before. He carried on with his life after, but one day, he heard a bunch of higher ups sullying the legacy of his great brother warrior and let’s just say….we don’t hear from them again. Dave ended up going back to fishing though, remembering the times he had with his brother.

        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Pyrana is a body builder Reptilian who emphasizes increasing her bulk over anything else in life. She somehow fits into all kinds of groups with her strong personality and feats, making her a likeable person by all. Pyrana’s life started on farm, plain and simple. Her father was in the farm business for a long time, and it was mostly successful. But as Pyrana’s father grew older, it started to slow. Both her mother and father were hoping for boys to help with the hard labor, but all they could get was one female. Her father and mother was distressed, but at the same time, there was nothing they could do. As Pyrana grew older, she would do more easy weight chores while she would watch her father work himself out. One day, her father broke his back, leaving him unable to do the heavy lifting farm activities. This would be the great moment where Pyrana was done doing her sissy-like chores and started to heavy lift. She started to pump iron religiously until she couldn’t, she would work every muscle until it was sore. She started to lift more weight than her dad currently could and proceeded to quickly pass the most he had ever carried. Her father and mother were truly proud of her feat, but she didn’t stop there. After The Dark Skies War, she took part in many different weightlifting competitions, going from place to place to show off her strength. Soon enough, she became an icon for all female Reptilians out there, making crappy but still motivational speeches and being the face of female strength. Today, she is still bypassing many men who come by her, and her will to pump iron never vanished. Pyrana’s dream is to become the strongest Reptilian in the world, while spreading the word and motivating others at the same time.</p>

        <p><strong>Description:</strong>  Larah is an emotionally berserk Zuku that can never have a moment of silence. She always is thinking about something, and she will never give anything a second thought, and it makes it worse with her genetic body. Larah was born in a regular household with her sister Jyaine, Larah was the older sister, and together, they were the best of friends who almost always got along. They had a happy family together; it seemed like nothing could go wrong. But when Larah was 11 years old, something terrible happened, she developed a horrific disease. The unknown disease caused her to lose hair and sap; she was dying all too quickly. When she rushed to the emergency room, they tried every medication they had. Over the past few days, nothing worked. But then, a crazy scientist named Tranel provided a solution. It was not full proof, but the parents wanted to do whatever they could, since she’d be dead in a matter of hours. Tranel explained it was a growth serum that would make up for her miss sap and hair, and that the side effects were unknown. Once she was green lit, Tranel injected the serum into Larah. In a matter of days, Larah was feeling better! It seemed as if the serum was a success, but the growth serum was just beginning. A few eeks after that, she started to hear voices, grow bigger overall, and grow + shed grass hair like crazy. It wasn’t long before Larah started to hear voices, like screams of her loved ones, being put through eternal pain. On one random night, all hell set loose with her, she seemed like a giant mutant, almost unrecognizable to be a Zuku. She went around destroying whatever she saw, she just couldn’t control her emotions, she didn’t know what to think. After wearing herself out from the tantrum, the Zukus captured her and put her in a deep underground cell made of the hardest wood and earth, and Larahs family had no chance to be able to see her again, as she was hidden in a top-secret place. Larah sat in that prison, slowly breaking the wood while going through nightmares at the same time. She went right through The Dark Skies War at 13 without even knowing it happened. After 12 years, she finally broke free from her prison. She traveled to the surface just to see everyone was gone, and the forest was overgrown. While some moments were calm for her, she still had her outbursts in the forest for the next couple of years, smashing whatever she sees for long periods of time. Larahs dream is uncertain, but somewhere deep inside, she wants someone to help her the most.</p>

        <p><strong>Birthday:</strong> February 7th</p>
        <hr>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Chioka is a fierce and uncanny Zuku that goes against every pacifist belief the Zuku’s have. Her desire is to convert everyone to be a more aggressive society so they can defend their nation, but instead of waiting for progress, she uses unnecessary force and teachings, she is a brute, and she knows it. Chioka’s story begins when she was a little girl in a happy family. She believed too once that pacifism was the way of ultimate living. She and her family would go out every day, supplying resources to the poor and praying at statues of the ultimate prophets of nature. She enjoyed this activity deeply, she thought anything was possible for her future, that she could too be one of those prophets. But those dreams all came to rest a one horrible day. She was 15 years old, Chioka and her family decided to adventure outside the Zuku Forest one day to have a picnic, everything around her was beautiful, she thought nothing could go wrong…..until she peered into the distance. A monster stared at them from afar, drooling with utmost hunger. Chioka was frozen in place, and when her family also realized it, they ran for their lives, Chioka did as well. During the chaos, she got separated from her entire family. About 5 minutes later, she goes looking for them……only to see them brutally torn apart by the monster. Chiokas dreams were shattered at that moment and realized every moment in life is a fleeting one, that death can happen at any moment. She wanted to do everything to prevent that. So, after mourning and praying for her family, she rushes back to Zuku village and screams at everyone about the attack, desperately trying to grab someone’s attention. At that they did, they reacted to this, but not in the manner Chioka thought. Chioka’s whole idea of safety and defense changed, she was hoping to get Zuku’s to use weapons to fend off or kill the monster, but instead, they went and hid. Chioka was asked so many questions in the bunker, but none of them mattered to her, only one thing was on her mind, and she spoke it loudly: “WHY ARENT WE KILLING THIS THING?!”. The Zuku’s went silent, gave her a disappointing look, and ignored her the rest of the time. While Chioka felt defeated that her opinion wasn’t understood, she instead was going to take action. After hearing about Igor and his defense progress, she joined it at 16, and for the next 3 years she was taught under Igor, until Igor realized she wanted more then slow progress and defense, she desired killing all monsters and forcing everyone under the propaganda. Igor ended up banning her from the dojo, but she scoffed at him and left. 3 years pass as she hones her skills and kills many monsters and The Dark Skies War hits, she watches as the entire nation goes through the worst, instead of helping any potential Zuku she came by, she watched. She watched all while saying, “I knew it.” In her head. After the War, she decided to go on a journey of her own that improves her strength even further. Then during parts of her journey, she would travel to the remaining living Zuku who still had the virtues of pacifism and teach them a lesson. Across 18 years, these lessons went from speeches, too actions, actions that almost hurt Zukus, but only haven’t because of Arrowite, her patience waivers quickly, and nobody may stop her if it does. Her dream is to drag every Zuku into the virtues of violence, not anymore to just defend themselves, but to make every other nation fear the Zuku’s for good.</p>

        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Igor is a masterful kung fu artist Zuku who spends his time mastering combat and defending his kingdom from all the threats possible. He is usually grouchy all the time, but his kindness shines through certain moments. Igor was born a long time ago, back when the Zuku’s were slowly evolving from a tribe. Back in this day, Zuku’s did use to be pro hunters and experienced with weaponry to defend themselves. Young Igor learned amongst all of the hunters and wanted to become one himself one day. Igor learned the ways of hunting, but he also felt as if something were missing, as if there was more to life then the hunt itself, so at age 17, he set off on his own adventure. From here, he would travel to every kingdom in search of something new. He started at the Crystal Kingdom, where he would observe the birth of crystals themselves with their leader, Ukara. Ukara was the kindest soul Igor ever met, they offered Igor high hospitality and education for how crystals work. From there, he traveled to the Centipedra Kingdom, back when they used to be above land with much darker skin tones. He learned how to endure multiple natural disasters and how to kill desert monsters, he even got a little spicy with another girl…. From there he moved to the Shadefolk, but he was not welcome with open arms in the main part of the kingdom and was quickly chased out. But he was able to find a Shadefolk that offered help and guidance. It was there that Igor learned how to farm, this would also be where he met Iris, and the group of three became good friends. After a while, Iris and Igor parted and the random Shadefolk stayed at his farm. Igor then traveled to the Frosts Kingdom, where he learned to endure the drastically cold weather and learned multiple survival methods that had nothing to do with fire, he found it astonishing. He made a pit stop at Pine Zuku Village, where he would meet Arrowite and train him and other pines to defend their village. After that, Arrowite become Igors disciple, and together they went to the Reptilian kingdom, where they learned multiple food recipes that blew their minds. This all happened over the span of 33 years, at age 50, he finally went back to the Zuku Kingdom but realized that things have changed. Violence wasn’t tolerated anymore, and Igor was struck with fear and disbelief. Together with Arrowite, they started to train as many Zukus as they could for combat, but it wasn’t much. The Dark Skies War Passed, and Igor disappeared after ordering Arrowite without a trace. Igors dream is as unknown as his current location, we may or may not see him again.</p>

        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Garvoch is a bold and stubborn Shadefolk who seeks a world of peace where Shadefolk don’t collapse under harsh conditions. In order to achieve this, he has dedicated most of his life to one thing: Killing his corrupt monarch father whose causing death. Garvoch was the middle child born amongst the Royality Shadefolk Family, along with Wuji and Reiss. The first few years of his life he grew up regularly, The Dark Skies War flew right over his head since they were well protected and in control. He first dreamed about being an elite soldier to serve the Shadefolk kingdom. While his father Yaozen paid no attention to him since Yaozen already got what he wished for with Wuji and the Dragon spirit, He was on his own basically. He was given proper soldier training and then proceeded to take interest in his dads actions. Each morning since he was 14, Garvoch would walk by Yaozen’s side, listening to anything Yaozen would give him. But each day they did, Garvoch would look out the window and notice the workers condition. Each day, Garvoch saw something worse and worse come to rise. What first started as a minimum number of casualties in labor and training has quickly risen with Yaozen’s demands, overall leading to more injury and death amongst the Shadefolk people. One day after seeing more than a quarter of labor workers die or be put out of commission, Garvoch snapped at his father, telling him how this is all so cruel. Yaozen and Garvoch then got into an argument, that ended up having Garvoch challenge his dad for the throne. But after a fierce battle, Yaozen came out on top by cutting off both of Garvochs arms, and Garvoch was banished from the kingdom. At 18, For 4 days he fended for himself, until he was greeted by a strange creature that was none other than Blendice.

His dream is to get revenge for his dads actions, whether that dream is justified by others is but a foggy vision.</p>

        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Wuji is a tactical genius and a wise monk at the same time. He has mastered and realized his own way of life and what path he wants to walk , the path that puts him at peace and makes up for his past actions. Wuji’s life begins as the first born of a new generation of Royalty. He lived life like the average spoiled rich kid. At age 10, Wuji was tested for his spirit. In which Wuji received the spirit of the dragon, said to be the most powerful one. This seemed to cheer up Yaozen after so many years, so Wuji wanted to embrace it for him. Wuji was then all of a sudden receiving all the attention from his father, they would eat at expensive places together, they would do various activities together, Wuji couldn’t have wished for better. Fast forward to age 16, Wuji is now undergoing an intense training regimen. He had never experienced such backbreaking work before, but he wasn’t going to let his father down now. As he continued to train though, his vision became foggy, between what was considered right or wrong was like watching someone shuffle two boxes with a ball under it at the speed of light. He lived his life and was the only one who was able to properly meet the queen of royalty and his mom: Afilia, before she fell extremely ill. Wuji saw her as a goddess, she would treat him with kindness and gave him a new perspective on the world. Life was great, but as she gave birth to Garvoch, she started to become less of herself. Then shortly after Reisses birth is when she passed away. Wuji was saddened, but then noticed something about his dad Yaozen, something that’s been changing inside him ever since she felt ill. It was a rare occasion that Wuji got to see his other two brothers: Reiss and Garvoch though, only late at night was when they hung out, and it wasn’t often. Now at age 18, he was put on the field for the ceremony for the peace treaty. When the Dark Skies War broke loose. He was ordered to go to the Reptilian segment to seize them since they resisted the most. This would be the time where Wuji would lose all reason, he started taking heads of Reptilian warriors like it was nothing. It only took one arrow for every kill, as the dragon strengthened his sense and power of the arrow. He then finally gets to a strange Reptilian warrior wearing a hat, who was also taking Shadefolk soldiers down at an incredible pace. He pulls back carefully and takes down this peculiar Reptilian. After that headshot kill was when a string was cut in his brain. He started to think with reason again. He struggles as he waddles over to a pond he saw a reflection of a demonic side. Struck by fear, Wuji flees the scene of the war completely. 18 long years passed after the war, and during that time, Wuji has learned how to live his life the way he wants it. He shook off his father and never returned to the Shadefolk kingdom. He now spends his time meditating and improving his skills to pass off to unfortunate souls that wander. Wuji’s dream is to continue to live in peace, but he feels as if somethings missing as well…</p>

        <p><strong>Gender:</strong> Male♂️</p>
        <p><strong>Age:</strong> 38</p>
	<p><strong>Role:</strong> Opportunist</p>
        <p><strong>Birthday:</strong> June 8th</p>
        <hr>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Carpacho is a top tier businessman and protector with a sole desire for money, he wants to abuse the current system that Yaozen has laid out and sit comfortably at the top for all of his life. Carpacho started his life normally, but he had very big behavior issues in his younger years. So, at age 15 he was kicked out of his home and school after an incident involving throwing someone through a brick wall. Carpacho would then look back at this moment often, but instead of thinking about what he did wrong, he thought about how strong he could become. He spent the next 5 years of his life making himself stronger. He took heavy doses of supplements that drastically increased his size overall, he can barely fit through doors. No other Shadefolk could’ve handled all of that, but he did, it even made his face more resistant to harsh weather, meaning he doesn’t need a mask as much as all the other Shadefolk’s. He was 20 when the dark skies war hit, and being on the poor side of the Shadefolk kingdom, they had barely any line of defense, so Centipedras, Reptilians, and Frosts took this opportunity to infiltrate out of rage of losing their people. But Carpacho was ready. Before the war, he buddied up with one of the engineers from Necros’s crew, their friendship slowly turned into a forced one. The engineer forcibly made a special new weapon never seen before (a machine gun) just for Carpacho, since he could solely handle the size and weight. Now as he enters the battlefield with a big grin on his face, he mowed down just about everyone that came his way. Since the weapon was so powerful, it even penetrated Reptilian scales. He easily shredded through all the species there as they fled in fear. The entire town was grateful for saving so many lives, some even gave him gifts. This is when Carpachos business would begin. For the rest of his life up to today, he charges people for their protection and has built a gang for the entire operation. The business was super successful, since the poor couldn’t afford proper protection, Carpachos was, well, cheaper than there’s. But if you don’t give him his money when he wants it, then its lights out for that person, that is exactly what made him feared, but no one could stop him. Carpachos dream is to bask in glory with the current government system and too also test his growing strength against more worthy foes.</p>

        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Yavel is an enlightened psychic with access to powerful telekinetic energy and slight access to vaguely see the future. The power she withholds comes with a curse that she cannot seem to get rid of. Yavel was born into a school of teachings for women. She spent her whole pre-adulthood in the confines of the walls. There she learned the ways of being a lady, back when she was born, ladies were taught to be housewives for men that defend the kingdom. This teaching almost drove Yavel too insanity, it is not what she want to do at all. Every time she got an idea to go pursue her own dreams, they were shot down by higher up females. When she turned 18, that was the age women would be ready to marry at the time. Yavel didn’t want to get married though, it was the last thing she wanted in fact. So, she fled the school and never looked back. The Dark Skies War came, and she was allowed in the safety chamber, after, she traveled to the rich side of the kingdom. Yavel sought out salvation from anyone. For 5 days straight, she looked for something that could help her find her way, but things seemed fleeting. Then, a strange building caught her eye, a skinny one between two very tall buildings. She doesn’t remember it being there in the first place, she thought she was hallucinating, but after opening the door it seemed very real. Inside was a stage, and a strange creature that looked like a Shadefolk but had tendrils for hair and a pumpkin shaped face. The strange creature looked over at her and frowned. “How are you here? And why can’t I get rid of you?” it spoke. Yavel said nothing. The creature started to panic but then realized what was going on and sighed. The creature immediately offered Yavel a change in her current life in return for forgetting this place, one that could set her on a-. Before the creature could finish, she accepted. The creature didn’t hesitate and sent her outside with a snap. The building disappeared behind her; she thought it weird that no one noticed but shook it off. A few seconds later, she went into a trance, in return for forgetting the creature and interaction, she gained immeasurable psychic powers. She was also in the royal palace now and was known as a psychic by everyone that rose to the top. Yavel wanted to feel different, but in fact, she couldn’t feel anything. That was the counterpart of the wish, she couldn’t convey emotions. Now she serves under the king, with everything she could want but her own emotions, this isn’t exactly what she wished for, but with what just happened, she feels that she now has a chance to make a change. Her dream now is to escape the kings grasp of orders to go pursue her own studies and figure out how to remember how she got here.</p>

        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Benton is a genius entrepreneur in ranged weaponry. He enjoys cracking lame jokes and testing the recently newfound weapon class of firearms. Benton was born after the Dark Skies War; he was one of the many Orphans during the aftermath of the war. Raised by caretakers, he was then given a single mother that he grew to love. She gave him his three meals a day and whipped him in shape to be a proper man. Even though his stepmother was part of the unfortunate, Benton was then able to go to school after his stepmother raised enough money and that was where he learned his interest in general weaponry. He was a very crafty kid, making all kinds of inventions, some that got him sent to detention. But as he grew up, so did his smarts in weaponry. At the same time firearms were invented by a group of people including Necros, he decided to improve that. At age 13, he was already a big shot, everyone noticed the precision of the new weapons Benton was making. The King also took interest in this same weaponry and hired Benton to be his own craftsman. Benton happily wanted to accept, until he read the terms, but just as he was about to decline, they would hold his stepmother hostage and kill her unless he worked for the king. Benton was now forced to accept. For the next three years he sat worrying about his mother, he was not allowed outside the kingdom walls, and he knew if he retaliated, his mother would be as good as gone. Benton was too afraid to make a move, so he just accepted his fate. Also, during these three years he has made rouge weapons off the chart, custom dual pistols for Bulletblade as a gift for helping his mother, and a Machine gun for Carpacho by force. Now he spends his time continuing to advance his weaponry, listening to Necros, and hitting on Estrailia. His dream is to escape the kings wrath and to see his mother safe again and hopefully get Estrailia’s attention.</p>

        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Estrailia is a rude but loyal right hand of Yaozen in the Shadefolk Kingdom. She will always follow the orders of the king and take down anyone that gets in her way. Estrailia was born after The Dark Skies War, she was also an orphan. But unlike a lot of the orphans like Benton who specialized in something, she had nothing. She had no guidance, and whenever she was asked what she wanted to do, she didn’t know what to say. Then one day, Yaozen arrived at the orphanage after the turmoil with all three of his sons, he needed someone to carry on the family tradition, someone who wouldn’t disobey because of his vision of the world. After stumbling across many kids, he found Estrailia, Yaozen started off by kneeling on one knee and asking questions. The questions Yaozen asked soon turned into orders, in which she would follow each one without asking why, no matter how stupid or silly the request. It was that day that Yaozen adopted a daughter. Estrailias goal was clear from here, he wanted to make Yaozen proud for giving her a purpose, so she would do no matter what it took. When he told her to stop running, she’d run an extra 30 minutes, when he told her to take breaks, the break time was halved. She was willing to go through what it takes, despite her not having a royal spirit, she wanted to do everything else possible that she could to make him proud. For the next 12 years of her life since adoption at 4, she trained nonstop and has chosen a short sword for weapon of choice. After hearing all the stories Yaozen told her about his sons denying his dreams, she was furious, she wanted to get payback on every single one no matter what. Today she sits by the kings side, still continuing her day-to-day training while also doing field work and scoffing at Benton. Her dream is to ensure her stepfather, who she considers her real father, will pursue her dreams and that she bestows payback amongst his sons.</p>

        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Necros, an absolute wonder of his time, a grand genius that no one could even fathom to begin. But all went down the drain after a horrible experiment had gone wrong and now he acts as if he were insane. Necros’s story begins with him being born into a middle-class family, the doctors said he was born with a condition that had his IQ increase at a rapid rate. It wasn’t long before he was solving Calculus problems at 7 and doing Physics by the age of 12, he was a remarkable genius. It was all anyone would ever talk about for a few years. Once Necros reached adulthood, he put his studies into the science department and the engineering department. During his science interests, he created many cures for the ill flooded diseases in the Shadefolk kingdom allowing life to be better for everyone. During his engineering phase, he crafted the first ever rifle to ever exist on the planet, and every other species built off of it, it was astounding. Nothing was stopping this handsome guy’s run. After engineering, he went back to biological science to pursue his studies, it was there that he discovered something unimaginable, something the other scientists could not comprehend: A new element. The new element he created had filled a hole inside him that was missing, he was feeling happy. But what you think was happening wasn’t really happening, the element consumed Necros and slowly, Necros began to transform. Horns grew out of his head, wings on his back, a tail of a hog, the tongue of a snake, the eyes of a twister, and finally, the occasional vocal cords of a chicken. The scientists finally reentered the room after the transformation. The scientists asked Necros if he was ok, and he only said one thing “I feel…..happy.” followed by a maniacal laughter and a chicken cluck. It wasn’t long before the scientist discovered he wasn’t smart anymore, and sadly, they had to put him in an insane asylum for some of the crude actions he committed after his transformation. For 20 years he sat in the asylum, but he didn’t mind because he was properly fed and was happy with his own thoughts. He didn’t even know The Dark Skies War happened. It wasn’t until later that the king offered him the chance to work under royalty, and everyone around them was confused. Necros nodded heavily in agreement. For the next 15 years, Necros concocted his own studies that resulted in failures 90% of the time, but every now and then, the stroke of genius would return. Necros’s dream is already fulfilled, he is just a happy guy! no matter what happens to him now he will always be happy with himself, he regrets nothing.</p>

        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Heveres is a fierce but ultimately loyal soldier in the Centipedra Kingdom. He is usually quiet and nonchalant but will always stand up for a female in clear danger no matter what.  Growing up in a household of sisters and a single mother, he witnessed and learned the ways of how the females benefited society and wanted to protect it. His mother grew more and more proud of him each day, as Heveres continued to respect his sisters work more and more and that he was able to get along with them really well. The Dark Skies War really proved this, as when they were all in shelter, Heveres would give them his food to eat. Heveres grew to be a fine male Centipedra, building up his body to his full potential and entering the army. There was a brief moment when everyone started to fear him, for it reminded them of a horrid male centipedra that caused chaos a long time ago. But after seeing Heveres kindness and compassion, they all quickly shook off the thought. As Heveres started to climb the ranks, all the female Centipedras loved him. He was asked multiple times to be a husband to many of them but declined because he believed he would interfere with their life, and maybe a touch of fear within himself too. But that didn’t stop them from liking him, he was very friendly and always found time to give his sisters and mother gifts. But one day, he lucked out while in the battlefield. A small war between the Shadefolk and Centipedras was brewing for territory and while Heveres took down more foes than anyone, they slit his throat slightly. Rushed immediately to the ER, he was going to recover fine, but his throat vitals were damaged, making his voice all fuzzy and grouchy and that it also hurt him to talk. After being fully recovered, Heveres was awarded the act of bravery by the queen of the Centipedras, an award that no male had received for a long time. Everyone was happy for his success, and Heveres couldn’t be happier seeing his mom smile for him. After that, Heveres was awarded a direct position to guard the queen, one of the highest positions in the army, and that’s where he stands tall and proud. Heveres dream is to continue to pursue his kindness towards female Centipedras and to never let it waiver.</p>

Back when times were desperate to quench thirst. She was only taught to do one thing ever since she was able to understand things, and that was to hunt. Each day she would either be honing her skills of hunting or putting them to the test against the upcoming threats of monsters. If you think she ever did anything else with her life until she was an adult, you’d be wrong, literally every day was hunting day to survive in the desert. She was taught the whole reason that they remained in the desert was for that plentiful amount of food supplies and that they are able to drill themselves underground using their bodies in sand only. Lisa never found time to relax, while she did enjoy hunting a lot, she felt as if she was missing out on her own life, that there was something more. So, when she was 22, she went out to go find that reason to live. She wandered the desert aimlessly, hoping she’d find something new and exciting, and boy did she get more than what she bargained for. The first few years, nothing special happened, but she noticed each year, the monster population was rising. It wasn’t until she was 42 that the real action happened, with only herself and her bow (rifles weren’t invented yet), she would fight hordes of rushing monsters in the direction of her hometown. She was very close to death one time as a monster snuck up behind her, but using the skills she had learned over the years, she handled it very well, she only lost an eye in the process! Her entire journey taught her that there was so much more to hunting and that she learned so many survival skills just by going off alone, the only thing she could’ve wished for was some company…. She returned to the hometown 3 years later to see that they had also grown, and that everyone seemed to have also developed hunting skills. But no one seemed to care for her return, she learned that her mother died during a monster attack, and her father fell into a quicksand trap, both parents lost to the cause of inexperience. She moved on passed this; she learned that no time is a good time to sulk. After The Dark Skies War passed, the development of the Shadefolk’s revolutionary firearms began in every kingdom. Lisa wished to qualify to test the weapons, and she did not disappoint anyone, she learned really quickly how the design of the rifle worked and studied for years to come. It wasn’t long before she was a well-known hunter across the board, and through all the fame, she somehow adopted a kid that adored her, Izzy. She is grateful for her kindness every day, as she feels it filled that hole she was missing when she was alone. Now in the current day, Lisa is teaching young Centipedras the way of the rifle and raising Izzy to be a fine woman like her. Lisas real dream though, is to see Izzy become successful and make friends someday, and she had a feeling it would come true soon.</p>

        <h2>Zeeneth</h2>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/4UUALxU.png" width="725" height="455" alt="Your Image">
	<p><strong>Species:</strong> Centipedra</p>
        <p><strong>Gender:</strong> Female♀️</p>
        <p><strong>Age:</strong> 22</p>
	<p><strong>Role:</strong> Nomad</p>
        <p><strong>Birthday:</strong> August 1st</p>
        <hr>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Zeeneth is a smooth and sassy kind of centipedra who loves all things that shine. She’s a huge lover of the community, and as every year went on she only grew to love it more and more. Her main role within the colony is as a traditional Centipedra dancer, often seen taking part in dancing for large events and celebrations. She was born in an extremely fashion-oriented family so when there isn’t anything going on, she’s often at home making clothes and jewelry for her friends and siblings. Even though the Dark Skies war was going on and she was only 4 years old, she helped her family maintain a semblance of peace and harmony amongst the people of the colony by making them jewelry and other things. Sometimes she gets embarrassed when the older Centipedras remind her of her old works from then, since she strongly believes that the things she made were an “embarrassment to her craft” even though she was only 4. She’s a very headstrong girl with a strong sense of determination and works  extremely hard to achieve her goals and dreams (even though they can change with a flip of a coin sometimes). Because of how sassy she can be and the way her mannerisms are, Zeeneth can sometimes come off as a bit catty or mean, but she just struggles with social cues sometimes and ends up getting pretty nervous when she wants to try and make a new friend. When she isn’t all nervous or slipping up, she’s actually pretty bubbly and a big sweetheart. Zeeneth, despite her visually lean appearance, is actually quite strong! Especially in her legs, her being a dancer being a result of that aside from her own personal training. She’s quite agile and a very fast runner and a majority of her main combat skill revolves around kickboxing. At first, she didn’t care about being “strong” or anything of the sort. She believed that her main purpose was to be a fashion designer, and that was it. But one day, she was roaming amongst the colony to bring a gift home for her younger sibling who made her first golden bracelet all by herself, she saw the warriors return home after the small war they had between the Shadefolk. She, of course, joined the rest of the other Centipedras who cheered and congratulated them on making it back alive, profusely thanking them for their efforts … but when Zeeneth looked each one in the eye, her mind started to wander. Perhaps one day, she could be a warrior herself. As crazy as it sounded, Zeeneth had always been somewhat obsessed with being a hero to her people in other ways than making clothes or jewelry, or dancing to the beat of a drum. After becoming an elder sister to two and her parents getting older and much less capable, she’s felt this undeniable urge to become a protector of those she loves most and what better way to do that than join the warriors in their battle! Ever since that day, she’s spent most of her days training her physical combat ability, honing her agility and endurance, even though she’s been put down into the dirt and discouraged by her older siblings who don’t take her seriously at all. Zeeneth had a history of having these huge, drastic dreams that she’d forget about in a week, but Zeeneth felt this calling in her heart. Her new and undeniable dream is to prove to her naysayers that she will be strong enough one day to fight alongside the elites like Ugarness, and that she wasn’t just another face in the crowd with unrealistic ambitions.</p>

	<p><strong>Role:</strong> Opportunist</p>
        <p><strong>Birthday:</strong> February 14th</p>
        <hr>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Decratos is a conniving, smart, and wicked rich male Centipedra that runs a club deep in the Centipedra underground. He enjoys nothing more then flirting with adult women, and having the best time with them possible, making sure the fun times they have is filling his pockets. His story began with a regular family, it was his mother, his father, and him. His mother though was not a very good person; she drank the nights away and often came home a wreck and even abused Decratos some nights as a kid. His father on the other hand was the best man he could be a fine businessman who ran a small weapons shop into a fashion shop for Centipedras. Decratos’s father put up with his wife to see if he could change her, to make her realize her mistakes, but that progression never happened. Decratos never really had any input at this time, but he enjoyed when his father would take them out for treats, one of the only good times he had. During The Dark Skies War, it didn’t help that each night felt like one of terror, worrying about death, but his father kept him comfort. One day, when Decratos was 13, his mother tried to kill him for not giving her what she wanted, and that’s where his father drew the line. A Divorce happened, but it was already too late, Decratos was scarred for life, he saw nothing good in his mother and that behavior rubbed off on other females he met, he would often flinch at the sight of them and give them nasty looks. His father didn’t like this newfound behavior, Decratos didn’t care, and left his father’s side at 16. Decratos learned something very important as he started to reach adulthood. In a society where females ruled supreme, males could very easily overtake them. He improved his physique so much, and since he was born with the rare 4 arm trait that his father also had, it made him even more powerful. But Decratos knew he couldn’t just go against the whole society, it wouldn’t work. Then he had a bright Idea that would change there society forever. A club, one where adult Centipedras can have a fun time and not have to worry about anything. A place where pleasure was gifted with open arms, no matter what you liked. For the next few years, Decratos had A LOT of action, he himself was starting to become an attraction for women. Decratos learned many things from his “experiences” with females, that they have a weak spot for males in terms of lust. Decratos took full advantage of that, and made his business thrive. Now Decratos’s club is one of the biggest hit places in today’s Centipedra society, and it wasn’t dying down anytime soon, not while Decratos was still planning for his ideal kingdom. Decratos’s dream is to emphasize male strength to others and to live in a kingdom where males could rule the day, and make his father see the benefits. </p>

        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Ugarness is a strong and independent female warrior who is a captain of the Centipedra army. She is super kind and helpful towards female Centipedras, but scoffs at some of the males actions and doings. Ugarness was born into a family of 6, mother, father, one sister, two brothers. She was the oldest of them all. Ugarness took immediate interest in fashion, she was obsessed with dresses and jewelry like nobody else. While she had these hobbies, each day of her life she would have to deal with her annoying brothers. It wasn’t sibling bias either, the brothers were really bad. They shaved pieces of Ugarness and her sisters hair as a prank, and it was just a prank bro. But as they all grew up together, Ugarness would see those moments that really matter, being a part of family, and cherishing those moments, she made various attempts to get along with their brothers, and 50% of the time it worked. She spent the next few years enjoying her hobby of dress collecting and such, but her brothers were still up to no good. In fact, it only got worse for them. One of the brothers joined a gang, where status was everything. It caused him to scream at his parents for not letting him stay here anymore since he developed many bad habits, soon after his depart, he was stabbed to death. As for the other brother, he started off on a bad path too, which Ugarness saw and made her realize how flawed males can be, she didn’t even care about what her other brother went on to be. Ugarness then decided to join the army, to be with the female segment and not have to worry about the males. During this time, she also had an outstanding growth spurt, sprouting to be the tallest Centipedra yet. Not only her height grew, but also her heart, as she was a shoulder to cry on for many females and put dozens of men’s heads in trashcans during the process. She was an Icon to all women around her, lots of women wanted to be like her, it made her happy to see that people were looking up to her. She also realized that males were looking up to her too, and thought, maybe there could be a change of heart. Today, she serves a top position in the army as Captain and ensures no female is left behind and that they are all happy. Ugarness’s dream is to demonstrate female strength to everyone and maybe try to find out what she could be missing about males.</p>

        <hr>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Girade is a villain Mastermind that wishes to dominate the top desert territory and is also a good artist. Girade is very envious and commanding of the monsters around them, he always has a pet peeve for keeping them in line. Girades’ story begins with an unknown story; he was born in Revendead and somehow made his way to Fraier. He gained consciousness then and already, his life was under immediate threat, a monster attack! He flees the scene as quick as he could. Girade quickly learns the dangers of life itself, and he just had woken up. This would set the tone for most of Girades’ life, as he grew in size, so did monsters. There was nothing Girade could do against them, he felt powerless. Any time in his lifespan that he would try to fight back, he ended up almost killing himself. With the constant pressure in fear, he almost couldn’t take it and thought about ending his life. He thought about how no one was there for him for years and that he would never make a single friend in this life. But before he could do so, he started to ponder, to ponder about his feats. He thought about how he has outrun every single monster he’s ever come across. Then at that moment, he realized its not just size and strength that contribute to the food chain, that he himself could be a predator. He immediately put this to the test with the upcoming rise of monsters in the desert. He used his speed and stamina too toy with the giant monster, and it worked, after it was tired out, Girade would run on the monster and take bites for himself where the monsters could not reach him, and he chowed in until they were dead. The continues to be a trend, he realized that he can be top of the food chain. But then Girade thought; “Why should I stop their?”. Instead of continuously being no better than the mindless monsters, he started to make them bow to his service after tiring them out and learned their ways of submission. It wasn’t long before Girade had a monster army of his own, ones that were barley sentient but still. Girade forced them to build an empire of his own on the surface and to expand his reign across the desert. He noticed the Centipedras on the surface, one of the species that also tried to kill him, so he returned the favor, and mercilessly sent monsters to their village to force them underground. During all of this, Girade continued to grow in height as well, to be a towering 3 feet and 2 inches tall! He made the monsters craft him a crown and robe to show even more dominance over them. In the current day, he still rules over the upper desert with an iron fist with an ever-expanding army, and a greed that will never be satisfied. Girades’ dream is to rule all of the lands and to prove to all that size doesn’t matter.</p>

	<p><strong>Role:</strong> Hero</p>
        <p><strong>Birthday:</strong> June 11th</p>
        <hr>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Farago is an energetic and taunting Crystal that’s always looking to pick a fight with anybody! With her moxie, and her sharp blade on her head, nothing is stopping her from charging into battle! Farago was born after the events of The Dark Skies War, born from the Crystal heart like everyone else, she was giving off so much energy that resulted in her having a quick birth. Growing up, all she desired was a skill check, specifically for combat scenarios. Like Tkaragem, she always thrived for a challenge, except for her, she was way more buggy about it. Instead of analyzing how she can learn from losing, she kept using brute force to try to solve the problem, and it barely works. As she grew older, nothing changed for a while as she continued to use her head only as a weapon. But one day, her attitude carried her too far, as after she lost in a spar with a mysterious deep dark blue crystal, she took her anger out on everyone else and started to destroy property. She went on this rampage, seemingly no one to stop her, until she suddenly felt her feet not touching the ground, as she was picked up by Barricrude with one hand. Barricrude started to yell at her furiously, until after a few minutes, he saw the absolute defeat in her eyes, one where she didn’t want to live anymore. Barricrude thought to himself for a moment and put Farago down. They talked for awhile and after, Farago didn’t feel as bad as she did. Farago decided to make a change in her life and to be more logical….. to an extent. She took on the role of helping townsfolk clean up the mess that she made and did it with pride. After she cleaned up her own mess, she didn’t stop there. She became an official helper for people across the kingdom, helping them with anything they need, her speed and head strength was unmatched by many others, making it easy to help the weaker and older with tasks they need done, so Farago always had her hands full. She lives with Barricrude to continue learning upon how she can improve and doing all of Barricrudes chores for him while he’s at the bar. She also took a large interest in Tkaragem’s rise, she became Tkaragem’s biggest fan and always nags him to train her to be like him. Farago couldn’t be more content with herself after learning from her past, she wants to continue to do the right thing. Her dream is to continue assisting all Crystals as long as she lives, and to train with Tkaragem to best the mysterious crystal figure she first challenged.</p>

        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Barricrude is a rugged, hefty, and hell of a solider Crystal that has the most amazing dad jokes ever. He will always make sure everyone he’s around is having a good time and showing those who cause bad times hell with his mace. Barricrudes incredible journey begins when he was a young adult. After education, he immediately enlisted himself in the Crystal Defense program, as he saw defending his nation was the most important thing to him. They went through a hell of training in the program, and despite all the exercise he did successfully, he still gained weight somehow. But the Crystal Defense program would be where Barricrude spends most of his life, he made all of his friends there, and those friends are what granted him his sense of wisdom. There was a LOT of drinking to be had throughout his middle age years, the amount of alcohol he consumed was beyond any other sentient creature to ever exist. When he was 29, it would be when the Dark Skies War hit, and he defended his nation with pride. He found happiness by using a mace as his preferred combat choice, and thanks to his humongous size, every Shadefolk warrior who tried to impale him would be met with the unbreakable beer belly. But alas as he smashed so many skulls, it wasn’t enough to win, after the heard death of Ukara, his section of the army retreated in tears, their leader being an inspiration for everyone in the kingdom was a loss that was too much for them to handle. After the retreat, everyone was in defeat, sitting at the bottom of the ocean thinking all hope Is lost, but Barricrude wouldn’t let that be the case, he rose his mace high and gave a speech to everyone around him and rallied them to a good cause. Thanks to that speech, it was one of the many pushes they needed to reclaim their land. 5 years later, they reclaimed the land and chased off the Shadefolk. After the successful reclamation, Barricrude would then retire from the Defense program, and he was awarded the second highest honor a soldier could receive. With all of the loans he got from that program, he decided to open a bar in a deep-sea light cave between the ocean and Crystal land. It was a good business choice because his bar was just visually appealing all around, no adult crystal could resist going there. He had learned how to make many unique drinks with his buds in the defense program and made them popular at his bar, it couldn’t have gone better for him. Quite a few years later, he would encounter Farago, a crystal who wasn’t taken into any family even at age 13. So Barricrude took her in and corrected all her wrong doings, he felt having a responsibility and most importantly, a growing family, would be important to him. Now he makes new dad jokes to tell Farago every morning and continues to run his successful bar. His dream is to continue to inspire, drink more then anyone ever has, and help Farago to grow up to be a fine female crystal.</p>

        <p><strong>Birthday:</strong> July 4th</p>
        <hr>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Takatoka is a friendly but extremely stupid explosives obsessed nutjob who loves to cause chaos amidst the crystals. Takatoka doesn’t realize what he is doing until he does it, which causes a lot of accidents that he has to make up for, he never learns from it and continues to live by: “Testing first, safety last.”. Takatoka’s life was interesting from the beginning, to start, his birth was not normal. When born from the crystal heart, the vessel usually enters out slowly, but Takatoka shot out like a bullet. This alarmed many crystals inside the structure of the Crystal Heart as he bounced around for a good 2 minutes until he finally got stuck. After that was all sorted out, nobody wanted to take him in since he looked “defective” with his jaw coming loose occasionally and the fact that he’s almost always cross eyed. Being without a family is never a bad thing in Crystal kingdom though because it lets them explore their passion more. During The Dark Skies war when Takatoka was only 3, he made his first explosive underwater, it was then and there that Takatoka found his passion. Takatoka would search the seas endlessly for explosive material while they were in the ocean for 5 years. Whenever he blew an arm or a leg off, he would make frequent visits to Gemeina for repairs, and it never stopped him from doing what he loved. After the victory of the Crystals and the emergence to land, Takatokas knowledge on explosives would only expand, when he discovered fire for the first time after hearing about it so much, it was like a gift of a lifetime. Takatoka got straight to work and built every kind of explosive there is. From standard set bombs too sticky C4’s, his knowledge seemed to expand for explosives only. Takatoka never had any personal problems before even, he’s never felt lonely as long as he has a bomb to comfort him during the night. But his carefree days of making bombs soon came to an end, when he blew a crater a bit to big in their land, almost wrecking local buildings. Takatoka was placed under arrest for a year, after his freedom, he knew it was time to change things up. He started a different kind of business when he turned 18, one that specialized in safety and cool looking explosives, aka fireworks. His store turned out to be really successful, and he even dabbled in explosive safety despite the quote he followed. He started to teach everyone about safety explosives, he donated money to good causes, and made sure every event ever was BOOMING. Over the past 3 years, everyone grew too like Takatoka and appreciated his works, even if he still caused a few bumps among the community. Even though now Takatoka can’t go buck-shit wild with his fireworks, he appreciates that others around him like explosives such as he does, and he found that to be more important to him. Takatokas dream is to still find a place to make the biggest boom and to have everyone stare in awe at it.</p>

        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Gemeina is a super intelligent mad scientist who’s dedicated to pushing Crystals limits and abilities. She will stop at nothing to enhance her experiments, even if that means doing it illegally, with her evil laughter and blood-stained hands, she will do what’s needed to be done. Gemeina’s story begins when she was a child. Her chosen interest was biology, specifically the Crystals biology and everything about it. That’s all she would ever study, she dived thoroughly into males raw and powerful strength and females intelligent minds, nobody was free from her studies except for Ukara, who had no biological gender and had the strengths of both species from the outside, but when Gemeina attempted to study them, results were inconclusive. As she evolved her studies, she learned there was more then meets the eye for standards for both males and females, as she grew older, males gained new traits of potentially being skinny, and females became average minded. She saw the curve of evolution and adapted to it. There was so much untapped potential she could experiment on. The Dark Skies war came, and she helped contribute to it by being hired as a temporary doctor. When they were pushed under the ocean, Gemeina spent the first year repairing crystals cracks and fractures, and she was appreciated for it. But it didn’t matter, because it didn’t satisfy her one bit. Going into the 2nd year underwater, she started to dig up deceased crystals most powerful pieces and use those to repair Crystals parts instead of what she is supposed to use. This first looked good, as it achieved the same recovery but better. But there were obvious side effects, like colors not matching and even worse, Crystals got sick off this kind of treatment. But for a whole year she did this until finally she was inspected, and they discovered that her genetic recovery’s that she was doing to Crystals were unauthorized. Her little program was immediately shut down, just because of some imperfections, her life’s work was stripped from her in an instant. She went silent in the ocean for the rest of the time the Crystals remained there, until the resurgence. After everyone successfully restored the land, Gemeina would also rise with new and enhanced experiments without the drawbacks. Except since she has explored every ethical way possible to experience biological enhancement, she started using unethical methods to feed her desire towards breaking sciences boundaries. One of these methods involves taking Crystals body parts ALIVE, and the Crystal would have no idea how it happened. Now she continues her personal business disguised as a doctor, but secretly a mad biologist. Her dream is to exceed Crystals limits and to discover how to make everyone like Ukara.</p>

Being a famous DJ across the crystals, there isn’t anybody that doesn’t know his name and a person that hasn’t listened to one of his songs! Tupa’s story begins in a weird way, because he was the first crystal to be born without color. No ones ever seen anything like it. For the first few years of his life, Tupa didn’t feel anything, no desire to do any activity or even just common interests. He would spend his time watching others delve into their own interests and try to see if he could find that light in him. But nothing ever showed. There was no one there to guide him, since Ukara was gone, nobody knew what to do with him except to try to let him be free like everyone else. Tupa ended up going into a major depression that no one knew how to cheer up either, no one knew what made him happy or even what made him cry, he didn’t have his own likes or dislikes. He spent his time all alone, and it almost drove him to suicide. But then he heard it, a melody. He stopped what he was doing and went to see what it was. It was raining, and there were garbage cans, the rain made a unique noise when it hit the garbage cans. Tupa heard this melody, and all of a sudden everything started to open up. He felt something for the first time in his life being 14 years old. He started to bang his hands off the trashcans and there it was, a groovy beat that he had just created! A beat that he wanted to add too, he started making a humming noise to follow the trash can, Yes! Yes! It was all coming together! Tupa had finally found his desire, making music. He got to work immediately, grabbed what he could find that made a cool noise and took it, everyone was happy that Tupa was finally doing something. Tupa would set up the equipment he has in a public place and just start playing. This immediately caught Crystals attention! The beat Tupa was making was too groovy to ignore! Everyone started supporting him and cheering him on. For the next three years Tupa would grow to be a famous music star, making music of all kinds of genres, but mainly dabbling in Techno. He also learned that he could fly with his fly fishlike wings. Now Tupa stands at the top of the stage and makes music for everyone to adore! His dream is to cherish this passion that he was given and to make sure no one ends up in the spot he was growing up.</p>

	<p><strong>Role:</strong> Hero</p>
        <p><strong>Birthday:</strong> November 1st</p>

        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Viviana is a Frost who is a snarky potion enthusiast who takes all her pride in being the only potion maker in the entire kingdom. She’s obsessed with gathering resources and won’t hesitate to hold back when trading with others, she must have it all. Vivana’s story begins with being born into a science family. Her father was looking for the next big thing to push Frosts power to the next level, and the mother was a caring housewife. Basically, being raised by her mother, who was always treating herself at weekends, Viviana was often left alone, and during that alone time, she would always get into everything in the house. She made “potions” using shampoo, cleaning spray, and any other odd liquid she could find, it would always end up doing nothing, but she was proud of it, so proud of it once that she drank it and made a trip to the hospital. But she ended up being fine, and in fact, all this would lead to her going on the journey of potion making. As she grew older and smarter, she began to actually use different natural ingredients to try to trigger a magical effect. After 4 years and being 14 years old, she perfected a trick that allowed her to levitate a piece of snow when the liquid was poured on it without melting it. Her father was proud of this and decided to assist her further. For the next 2 years she learned how to make snowworks (fireworks but with cold elements.) and enhanced her previous potion to allow herself to pour it on a stick and have the potion string itself from the piece of snow she was pointing at and lift it around everywhere. The Dark Skies war hit shortly after, Vivana and her whole family were safe, but the air was filled with fear, everyone she saw was shaking or crying from the loss or injury of family members. She decided to see if she could cheer everyone up using her snow lifting magic, she starting picking up a piece of snow and swinging around, everyone near her took attention to it, it seemed to calm them all down. It only took about a half hour to get everyone smiling as she would add small fireworks and more impressive tricks to what she could do, she received applause, and it lightened the mood of everyone in the bunker for the rest of the duration they stayed in it. After The Dark Skies Wars pass, her career took off as her father kickstarted her projects and she got straight to work. 15 years of work have gone by, and she makes spells and knacks of all kinds now, she’s become heavily obsessed with the point that it takes over her daily life. Now she still continues this life, content with all of the progress she has made in her Icy tower. Her dream is to branch outside the Frost kingdom someday and get other resources for her potion making career.</p>

        <hr>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Torean is a young sports lover who dedicates his entire reason for living to stopping soccer goals and scoring hockey ones. He is always a high energy player who looks out for his team but sometimes gets carried away with himself when he pops off. Torean was born after The Dark Skies War. Ever since he was able to walk, he has had that desire for competition, but straight violence was not an answer he liked to hear. Instead, one day, he and his family went to one of the first sporting events ever held 4 years after the war. Torean was obsessed with everything, how the players would move, how they used teamwork to pass the ball in cool ways, just everything was perfect for him about it. The thing he was most obsessed with was during soccer games, how the goalie would deny goals, one after another, that drive to stop the enemy team and make them feel defeated from not scoring was exactly what he was looking for. Ever since he watched all those games, he’s done nothing but go home and dribble a ball, every single day, he practiced and practiced until he couldn’t, he would get home from school, playing with a soccer ball, eat dinner, then play with a soccer ball again until his parents told him it was time to go inside. At age 12, they finally introduced sports to education programs, and I think you can guess what Torean did immediately: He signed up for soccer, along with a bunch of other young men. He immediately showed his prowess to the coach with all the practice he had learned, the coach was impressed, but he didn’t solidify Torean’s position. Torean was confused, why was he being subbed out? He was clearly the best, so he thought he had to try harder. He would ball hog from others and score as many goals as he could, the coach still didn’t do anything. Furious, this drive for being better led him to yelling at a teammate, and that’s where Torean would sit his first game on bench the entire time. The coach had an important talk with him, then Torean realized, it wasn’t about being the best, it was about being a team. 5 years after that talk, he has improved himself as a team player better than ever, he would cheer on teammates, never ask questions about being subbed out, and made friends with his teammates that he cherishes, which led to him playing more and during that play time, he made sure to use his team to his advantage to be better overall. Now he continues his sporting career, while also picking up hockey to try to learn because he also liked it. Torean’s dream is to make it into the big leagues of Soccer and become champion with his team and bask in glory.</p>

	<p><strong>Role:</strong> Hero</p>
        <p><strong>Birthday:</strong> July 29th</p>
        <hr>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Tunundra is a jolly and reckless Frost who is an old man with the mindset of an 8-year-old. He always takes his life to the extreme, he seeks cool ways to take out his enemies other than just some boring old sword or firearm, and his frost railgun keeps him interested enough. Tunundra was born into a family of lumberjacks, ever since he was able to wield an axe, he cut wood for his father. He did what he was told, up until he was 11 years old, then he just gained an immediate sense of rebellion. When told to cut wood, he would instead go run off to find his friends to hang out with and have snowball fights with. When he was caught, he was punished with beatings, but he thought the beatings were worth it for the happy times he had. This trend would continue until he was 16, and his dad put him into a lumber job that he didn’t want, but he didn’t have a say in the manner. This time it was harder to run off since he was on the clock. He accepted defeat for the first week but then realized that there was still ways that he could have fun. Using the wood he was supposed to cut at the lumber factory; he started carving it. He carved all sorts of little wood figures, some monsters, some people, it turned into a massive hobby of his. But he was caught for 2 weeks and fired from his job. 2 years later, he would enter the army and get physically fit. His humor compared to others was stupidly different, no one would laugh at Tunundras jokes, usually because they were lame dad jokes. He wasn’t favored in the army either, he was always trying to make some new weapon out of the ones supplied that always ended up getting people hurt. They didn’t really like him, but that all would change when they first got sent out to defend the nation from snow beasts of the wild. Tunundra always took the hits he could, no matter the person, it was a miracle that he never broke any bones. He had built a snowball gun just to annoying the monster and lead them on a wild goose chase away from comrades into chasms if he could. After that first line of defense practice, everyone loved Tunundra, they would ask him out to go drink, do activities together, and some people even laughed at the stupidity of his jokes. This trend would continue for over 6 years as he continued to build up bonds and make new friends. When The Dark Skies War hit, the time for fun and games for him were over, though, he had to grow up and use real weapons for a real war, something he hated to do, but knew he had too. After the War, he was traumatized by the number of lost comrades during battle, he went into depression for about a year. After that depression was when he finally told himself to snap out of it, and he started being himself again. For the next 17 years, he continued his old pace where he left off, grew a fantastic beard and kept his child like behavior going. Now he stands tall and proud with new comrades, despite them being a little younger than him, he didn’t let that bother him and got along with the young ins just fine. His dream is to ensure none of his comrades get hurt again by the evils of war, and to keep his child-like mind entertained.</p>

	<p><strong>Role:</strong> Nomad</p>
        <p><strong>Birthday:</strong> Janurary 21st</p>
        <hr>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Grace  is the sweetest social butterfly and loving girl who wants to befriend anyone she meets. Ever since she was young, Grace has been the kind of girl that greets everyone she walks by and wishes them a wonderful day. She works at a small, modest diner as a waitress and a cook and although it tires her greatly, she believes that the smile she’s able to put on people’s faces through food and a kind word is just enough to make it worth it! She also works as a cosmetologist from time to time, which brings her just as much joy. Because of her kind nature, she has plenty of friends and is quite popular amongst the Frost! Even so, she stays humble and down-to-earth and never puts herself above anyone, even those who’ve done plenty wrong. She believes even the cruelest and darkest of hearts have a shred of gentleness inside of them, and that it should never be ignored. This often leads to her getting into trouble, some people taking advantage of her good heart for their own personal advantages. A big part of why she’s so insistent on bringing beauty and positivity to the world around her is the Dark Skies War itself. Though she was barely only a few months old when it happened, she is fully aware of the devastation the war brought to not only her people, but her own family. She lost her father in that war, and the impact that had completely shattered the heart of her mother. She couldn’t stand seeing her mother cry almost every night with his photograph in her hand, couldn’t stand seeing that almost permanent, solemn frown on her weary face, and she did absolutely everything she could to make her mother smile at least for a second. She learned how to cook, clean the house, sing and dance, all at a young age to care for her mother and be the best daughter she could be.  That mindset stayed with Grace even in the present day. Her mind fully is set on bringing as much light as she can on the world around her that has been darkened by the misery of the war, even if that’s something as menial as saying, “I sure do love your hair today, gosh it makes me jealous!”  Her dream is to bring love and compassion to people around her and to make as many people smile as she can.</p>

        <p><strong>Birthday:</strong> June 30th</p>
        <hr>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Ludicrous, a Frost with undying wills for revenge, the spire of tactical precision and ultimate freezing power. Ludicrous desires to make all the Frosts suffer for the misconduct done with his treasure. Ludicrous’s Story really begins when he was 25, the first ever floating ship on water was crafted by him and his crew, a ship of large mass, powered by the Frosty winds. This crews only desire was to search for treasure amidst the sea. Ludicrous was the captain of the entire crew, and they were all happy and jolly about the set sail too sea. They had been planning this for over 3 years and intended to sail for at least a year before returning to Frost land. The crew set sail and their great journey for riches begins. Ludicrous made sure all his fellow comrades were at top tier condition, when someone was hungry, he gave them his serving of food, if they were cold, he would give them his coat, he was everything a good captain would be. 4 months on the sailing trip, they were attacked by a sea beast, but it was something they could easily handle, they had prepared for creatures of the deep. They ended up victorious and ate the beast over the span of 2 weeks. 6 Months in, Ludicrous falls ill, he had come down with some ocean like disease, making his skin turn pale. His comrades took care of him well, something Ludicrous would forever appreciate. 9 Months in, they fight another sea beast, this time, more powerful, smarter, this wouldn’t be an easy fight. The result was yet another win, but at the cost of some of Ludicrous’s comrades life’s, Ludicrous would never forget their sacrifice. Finally, 11 months in, they would find their biggest score, something that could change many lives forever. It was a mountain, and when inside the mountain, there were crystals and jewels beyond appeal of anything ever seen before in Drevator. They claimed all the treasure, but the next thing coming was something they would never expect. As they sailed away from the mountain, A loud roaring noise went off. They looked back only to see a ginormous green creature fly out of the cave. Luidcorus went mad and gave panicking orders to everyone, but before anyone could do anything, it was too late, the beasts lightning speed put itself in front of the ship. It charged up a seismic beam of light, and unleashed it without hesitation on the ship, splitting it perfectly in half. Ludicrous, who was standing right in the middle, lost half of everything but his bones, as the ship split and went down, so did Ludicrous’s corpse to the bottom of the ocean. Almost a decade would pass, as his corpse rots in the ocean, until one day after The Dark Skies war, he sees an image of a strange, hooded figure with orange eyes and awakes. Ludicrous wakes up, he wakes up and looks around, he was back on Frost grounds. He looks at himself in fear, as he is somehow alive with half his vitals. He quickly shakes off the thought and thinks about his treasure. He looked around to discover his ship was hauled back in, but when he looked, all the gold and jewels, gone. Ludicrous knew the treasure made it back because all the chests were present. Ludicrous was seething with rage, he was going to ravage the entire frost village to the ground with the newfound ice powers he had, but alas, the power came with a curse, one that doesn’t let him leave a defined area of the Frosts land. Now he sits dormant in a skull ice cave he crafted, waiting for the curse to wane at any minute. His dream: To kill all the Frosts who dare took his gold from his comrades and himself.</p>

        <p><strong>Birthday:</strong> September 30th</p>
        <hr>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Blendice, an alien trapped in his own mind, in a state of mind where he believes everything can be better, and yet perfection is a myth. Blendice’s only purpose in life is to make monsters, monsters capable of unusual things, ones that live for a single-minded purpose and nothing more. The story began on an unknown planet of aliens somewhere in the galaxy, they were by far the most advanced species of all time. While most villains have a sad backstory or a motive with a deeper meaning, Blendice was made to be heartless. Killing both his parents while he was only 19 for no reason, and he got away with it, no one suspected a thing. Blendice grew up to repurpose himself in evolution, to exceed limits no matter what it took. He would do tests, tests on himself, tests on others he captured, he never had time for anything else, he didn’t sleep or eat for a whole 2 years, and when he did eat and sleep, the time he went without doing it would increase. The data he covered over the span of 31 years was invaluable, it was more knowledge that anyone could ever handle, it would drive most people mad, but Blendice was already mad, he IS the definition of a mad scientist. He realized his studies could expand further through the funding of the people. He got the favors of the people through donations, solving an ungodly number of diseases and cures, and investing well in stocks. At this time, Blendice would be rich, but none of that mattered to him; what mattered was knowledge, because knowledge is power. Blendice would then one day reveal his ideas to the world, how he can turn everyone infinitely better if they were completely repurposed to do a single task, and thrive in that task. Why does he want this you ask? He will tell you its just because he wants to. Everyone was flabbergasted and distraught by the idea. Blendice, emitting unfathomable rage through everyone denying his life purpose, would shout: “Milliarden von Jahren der Evolution, und ihr seid alle immer noch dreckige Affen!!!”. Everyone was shaken by the thought, a few people fainted. Blendice was going to be put in immediate arrest for this, but he prepared well for the situation, a simple teleport to an emergency spacecraft he was able to hack, he flew immediately off the planet. Law enforcement caught up, but it was too late, as Blendice activities a hyper drive. Once it went through, he never looked back upon the failures he saw. His hyper drive shot took him to a planet no other than Drevator. As his machine malfunctions, he tries to start it up again, slamming it and calling it a piece of junk, which caused purple unstable clouds to emit from the machine. After that, it started to crash land, and he ended up in the far west part of the continent. Nothing about the crash bothered Blendice as he got straight to work out of the broken ship to study the new land he’s on. 18 years pass, and he has made phenomenal progress, making subjects like Razorox and Charlotte to serve their single-minded purpose…or at least to an extent. Now he stands, continuing to contribute to his new master plan and carefully monitoring all species without raising suspicions. Blendices newfound dream is to overtake every species on Drevator and envelop everyone in the same dream he had on his original planet.</p>

        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Razorox, the true embodiment of heart and soul in a soldier, is a fierce and occasionally freaky dragon monster that serves Blendices every command. He will ensure he does his combat tasks effectively and swiftly to meet all of Blendices expectations. Razorox’s story starts when dragons first discovered Drevator. It was a small group of green scaled dragons, specifically males that chased down females for specific reasonings. After those specific reasonings, Razorox’s egg was made. But the egg was left behind, the dragons didn’t desire to take care of a baby. The Dragon egg ended up hatching, cute baby Razorox climbed out, the only reason he survived was the fact that he hatched near the desert and stayed warm consistently. For 2 years, he ended up being raised by a pack of wild monsters that barely fed him anything, the monsters intended on eating him later anyways. The Dark Skies War came to pass and while in a cave of monsters it was when they intended to eat him, they managed to get a few bites, but Razorox escaped. Now wandering on his own, living off nothing but a few berries for a year, Razorox felt defeated, and collapsed to the ground. With hazy vision, he sees a purple figure walking up to him in a lab coat. It was Blendice, he picked big baby Razorox up and said, “Your name is Razorox, and you are mine now.” As Blendice carried him under his shoulder. Razorox wakes up, and he wakes up in a nice fluffy bed. He wakes up to see all his bitten off pieces restored and off to the side of the bed, a bowl of weird but plentiful amounts of food and a big canteen of water. Blendice walks, Razorox was still weary of him, but all Blendice did was comfort him by petting him. His fear stopped, as he looked up at Blendice, smiling with his sharky mouth and lack of expression in his eyes, he felt safe, and felt that from now on, everything was gonna be alright. For the next year, Blendice gave Razorox many injections, ones that he didn’t mind because he felt Blendice knew best after imprinting on him, and the fact that he got a big snack after. Soon after a year, Charolette was brought into the same laboratory, and when Razorox first met her, he tried to eat her, but then realized it was a friend not food after being zapped. Razorox regret ever thinking the idea that she was food because he had the time of his life with Charolette, they were best friends in no time, as they played games together, running around the lab, those were the best parts of his childhood. But as both of them grew into adulthood, they saw each other less and less on accord of Blendice. Blendice continued his experiments and tests, sometimes hurting Razorox, but he couldn’t get mad at someone who took care of him his whole life. At age 18, Razorox became the top tier weapon Blendice was hoping for, his fire breathing turned into extreme acid, burning through about anything, and his muscles were BIG. As for side effects, he has a slight speech disfunction with a lot of “f” sounds and occasionally likes to act freaky to be silly. Blendice didn’t mind those side effects though as long as he obeyed orders. For 2 years, Razorox preformed perfectly for Blendice, watching over all the kingdoms without attracting attention and if anyone got too close to the lab, Razorox would snatch and eat them. Now Razorox still stands tall as Blendices top soldier, making sure to continue to obey every command of his. His dream is to make Blendice, who he sees as a father figure, proud, and to hopefully get to talk with Charolette in the future…</p>

        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Charolette is a creepy but cute spider monster that is the one army maid for Blendices messy lab. She has major OCD and makes sure every single thing in the lab is in top condition, and she enjoys it very much. Charolette’s story begins in the Spiders Mountain, where Spricados gave birth to hundreds of thousands of children, she was one of them. Like her spider brothers and sisters, she stayed in the cave with their mother, being safe. But as time went by, Spiders began to choose to leave the den, and so did she. After her departure, she realized life was not easy in the outside world. She was small, and anything could instantly end her life. She kept spinning webs for a long time, traveling all over, since that’s all she knew how to do. But then, the horrible weather condition came…..rain. For the first time in her life, she felt she was in danger. She panicked as she swung for her life, until she hit something, something white and purple, it was Blendice. Blendice, with his amazing alien sense, noticed the stressed spider, he watched her crawl up into Blendices lab coat. Blendice pulls her out and holds him in his hand, while holding the other one above her to stop the rain from hitting her. “Hmmmm, a perfect specimen.” Was what she heard before blacking out. When she woke up, everything was different for her. To start, she was bigger, like WAY bigger than what she was. Secondly, she noticed she had quills similar to a porcupine on her back. She climbs out of the fluffy bed and notices food and water for her, and a ginormous web of silk on the wall. Blendice walks in, and like his previous subjects, just sits there and comforts her. Charolette felt at ease, knowing it was the same person that saved her life. Blendice would then continue to give her shots, but she didn’t care as well, knowing she gets a tender snack after everyone. Then at age 3, Charolette was introduced to Razorox. When Razorox tried to eat her, she didn’t mind actually, she was weirdly ok with the fact her life was in danger. After those few bumps, they became best friends, she grew up most of her life with Razorox and treasured the times they had together. But Blendice would end up separating the two as they grew up. Charolette received many modifications to herself involving intense and confusing combat moves she learned. At age 17 was when her true OCD kicked in, Blendice ran many tests involving her cleaning messes, she succeeded at them all. Now at the current day, she is Blendices best and only cleaner of the lab, the thought of cleaning always made Charolette happy, that and making Blendice proud. Her dream is to make the entire lob spotless, a dream that already has come true, but she does want to meet with Razorox more if possible…</p>

        <p><strong>Description:</strong> 影、無の幻想 Sourczess is a strange and creepy creature that never knows what its doing. It finds happiness out of necromancy, that’s it, we don’t know much about the specimen. Sourczess was born from the shadows, no one knows how the creature came to life, only that it was small, like a gremlin. The creature hated light, because it’s the only thing that can hurt it seemingly, it moves like a shadow, untraceable. 空虚な心を抱えたまま、世界に入る。 The creature could never speak either, or when anyone saw its appearance, they would faint. The creature sulked, the creature cried, the creature wanted to know what it was. It searched and searched, searched for an answer, a sign, anything to make it happy. It searched for thousands of years, no progress to be made. Then The Dark Skies war would hit, the creature was amazed, amazed by its  appearance. 光が空から降り注ぎ、影の生き物が襲いかかる。 The creature felt something, something good, something great in fact. The creature watched all the species fight, fight from the shadows. It found it entertaining. After that though, it was back to sadness. The creature cried, cried its hearts out. Until it heard something, it heard a call, call of something special. The call led him to the west ocean of the continent. There he found his special thing, a vessel. その生き物は完璧な器を見つけ、それによって目的を見つける。 The creature felt satisfied; despite not using the vessel effectively, it found purpose within it. The creature managed to wander, wander until it found a lab, it walked right in, no troubles. Razorox had spotted the intruder late but ended up catching them. Razorox brought them to Blendice, Blendice saw perfection in the creature and decided to keep it. Strangely, Blendice didn’t do anything about it, because he knew doing anything to it would be a bad idea. So, the creature wandered the lab. After some time, it learned necromancy, in a field not far off from the lab, it would resurrect an entire Graveyard, bringing back many baby skeletons that used to be little goblins species that went extinct, along with it, a bigger skeleton, who recognized herself that she was somehow alive, it was Cocy. それは死者に命を与え、その目的を果たしています。 Sourczess brings them back to the lab, it is congratulated by Blendice, it doesn’t know what it did, but it felt happy. Now Sourczess continues to wander the lab aimlessly, speaking in a gibberish it has learned from everyone that was friendly towards it. Its dream? 死.</p>

	<p><strong>Species:</strong> Monster</p>
        <p><strong>Gender:</strong> Male♂️</p>
        <p><strong>Age:</strong> 23</p>
	<p><strong>Role:</strong> Opportunist</p>
        <p><strong>Birthday:</strong> November 7th</p>

        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Blaze is a cocky and hotheaded piece of fire that loves taunting his enemies and then burn them to a crisp. He can get carried away with things a lot of the time, but he makes up for it by guaranteeing revenge, even if that means death for himself. Blaze’s life began in the Volcano in the desert; he was barely sentient and more of like a blob at the beginning of his life than anything. He would continue to sit in the volcano for 5 years, until during The Dark Skies War, the energy sped up his growth, and he became of the fire spirit he is today. But the charge and early birth came with a curse, a high-power sun beam would always constantly be shooting from his eyes as long as they were open, and it hurt him badly. As long as he kept his eyes closed, he was fine though. So, learning how to do all the things like walking and eating without being able to see. Whenever he felt threatened, he would just open his eyes to obliterate the target. The life he lived was pretty lonely, due to his high temperature that he couldn’t control, no one could be around him without getting severe sunburn. This life would change soon, as he hears someone mysteriously approaching him. Like always, he opens his eyes to defend himself, but the figure blocks it with a weird shield made of an anti-heat material. No matter how long Blaze kept his eyes open, it seemed to do nothing as he barely saw the figure. He couldn’t hold them open any longer and gave in to defeat. Blaze ended up being dragged around by a figure holding a glove of the same material, it was none other than Blendice. For 3 years, Blaze was dormant and asleep inside a strange container, as Blendice conducted experiments on him. After, he was released in a test chamber, where Blendice would observe his awakening. When Blaze woke up, he had the immediate sense to burn everything around him, but he failed. Then after a few minutes, Blaze realized a few things. Firstly, he was flying, he didn’t know how, but he was. Secondly, he had shades on, made of soggy obsidian to cleanse the flame beam effectively, meaning for the first time in his life, he could see clearly, he took them off as a test, but flame blames still came out of his eyes, but it didn’t hurt as bad, he put the shades back on, and it went to normal. Blaze then noticed where he was and saw Blendice, he flew up to where he was very slowly. All Blaze could get out was a thank you, he didn’t know how to express his gratitude, thinking that his entire life would’ve been so bad if it weren’t for Blendice. Blendice asks for Blazes assistance in his project, and after some talking, Blaze accepted. Blaze was only upgraded from now until present day, he could control the heat radiation he gave off, made friends with everyone else in the lab, and got a cocky attitude from how powerful he realized he was. Blendice decided to send him out to the desert again to keep his watch there, as a Tyrant comes to rise, Blendice didn’t want anything to do with him, Blaze accepted. Now Blaze lives his life to the fullest, burning monsters whenever he feels like it and messing around with the volcano to cleanse his boredom. Blazes dream is to burn as hot as the sun, he wants everyone to recognize just how powerful he is, that’s all he has wanted for a long time. </p>

        <h2>Cocy</h2>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/wZHS1Hy.png" width="725" height="455" alt="Your Image">
	<p><strong>Species:</strong> Monster/Shadefolk</p>
        <p><strong>Gender:</strong> Female♀️</p>
        <p><strong>Age:</strong> 146</p>
	<p><strong>Role:</strong> Neutral</p>
        <p><strong>Birthday:</strong> April 9th</p>
        <hr>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Cocy is a sweet and caring mother-figure who takes care and watches over all the baby skeletons brought to life by Sourczess. She always try’s her best to be a mother figure to everyone in the lab, and everyone appreciates her company, even Blendice by the smallest amount. Before Cocy was a skeleton, she was born a Shadefolk in the early days. Her life consisted of the average female stereotyped jobs, as she shuffled around from house cleaning, farming, and serving the richer men. But when she turned 18, she ran off to find true love. Cocy searched for days, and with the money she saved up from working 20 hours a day, she thought she could find someone to love within that time. It wasn’t until Cocy was about to give up that she finally had found it, while at a bar, she bumped into a fine gentleman on the way in, and it was love at first sight. Cocy has only ever wanted a child to call her own. So, for 3 years, they dated, did all the things Shadefolk could do, it was a great relationship, Cocy and her boyfriend found happiness. It was then and there they decided to get married, and her boyfriend couldn’t have agreed more. They got married in that same year, and within about the next year, they finally did the deed. But, when 9 months came around, nothing happened. They went to the doctors and learned a terrible discovery. Cocy, who wanted this child more than anybody in the whole world, couldn’t have it, because she was infertile. It was devastating news to her; she couldn’t believe it. Her husband tried his best to comfort Cocy, but nothing seemed the same after hearing the facts that she was never going to have a child she could call her own. From there on out, as happy as she tried to be with her husband, she couldn’t help but to cry every night, thinking about the fact that she would never have a child ever in her life. Her husband tried everything, he even mentioned adoption, but Cocy was not interested one bit in the idea, it was not the same to her. Cocy continued to live her life in depression, and the couple grew old together. But then one day, her husband collapsed and died at the age of 89. Cocy, now even filled with more depression that no one is going to be there for her, leaves the Shadefolk Kingdom. She walks far west towards the land in the middle of the Frosts and the Reptilians and sits, sits there and cries. She looks up at the sun one last time, before deciding to hang herself at 92. It was tragic, some earthlings found her rotting corpse 4 years later and buried her in the spot by the tree. 40 years would come to pass, and her body decayed to bones. Until by some miracle, Sourczess resurrected her back to life. Appalled at first, she didn’t know how it was possible, she looked at her dirty boney body in fear and collapsed to the ground in fear. But then, she was approached by a baby skeleton, and it hugged her. At that moment, she stopped shuddering, and looked at the Skeleton, despite not being able to talk, she felt as if it was saying: “Mama”. And then all of a sudden, she heard it from hundreds of baby skeletons around her, it was a miracle too her, she finally had got what she wanted, while screwing the fact that its similar to adoption. For 10 years, she raised the baby skeletons inside Blendices lab, obviously they were still babies and forever will be, but they learned a lot in that time. Now she watches over all her babies happily, while spreading her positivity to others in the lab as well. His dream has come true, she has all these skeleton babies that she can call her own, Cocy couldn’t be any happier.</p>
