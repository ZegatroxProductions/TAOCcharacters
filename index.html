	<h2><p style="color: green;">Ver 1.0.03</p></h2>
	<p style="color: limegreen;"><h2>Updates: April 28th</h2>
	<h3>Welcome to <u>The Adventures of Crizion</u> Website! Where you will be able to explore all the original characters that I wish to be featured in future entertainment of any kind! For this update, There are two new buttons: The "Fanart Gallery" where you can check out other peoples art relating to TAOC. Then "Learn about Species" where you can get a better idea of what my weird species are like! There is still also the "The Dark Skies War" button where you can learn of the tragic tale of what happened before the present-day story of TAOC. Also, Axol and Pelestia now have there descriptions! More descriptions will come eventually! Finally, the ages shown here are still not final and may be subject to change. Thats all I have to share, enjoy the website!</h3>

    <h1>The Dark Skies War</h1>
    <p>The Dark Skies War is a war that changed the way of life for all species around the Fraier continent. The war occurs about 18 years before the present plot. Our story for this war begins after some species undergo their own mini-industrial revolutions. The Reptilians discover waterpower as a form of energy. The Shadefolk were able to construct weak but functional firearms and branched off weaponry of the category.  The Frosts were able to make hundreds of quality-of-life changes to their lifestyle. Others at the time were not doing much, The Zuku, Crystals, and Centipedras all focused on survival in their own ways. During this time was also the peak of the trading industry that all major kingdoms participated in, it was truly the pinnacle of the time. While this was going on, The Shadefolk sent a request to each kingdom proposing a continent-wide peace. Since nothing has really been officially established and no conflicts seemed amiss, all kingdoms accepted. This also gave species the chance to meet with ones that are placed polar opposites from each other, gaining an even friendlier alliance from there it was only a  matter of time before the species would gather. The meeting place was the center of the continent, where a massive stone cylindrical podium was built by earthlings after receiving message of the truce. Everyone eventually meet around the middle. It gave species a chance to talk to each other. 
</br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ljiKFuR.png" width="725" height="455" alt="Your Image">
</br>
The Reptilians were open arms to anyone, they were as happy and jolly as they could be, offering unique foods, explaining their culture, and having a nice laugh with everyone. The Zuku were also very generous, thousands of gifts were made prior to the day of meeting to give out to any of the other species. There couldn’t have been anyone more peaceful there than the Zuku’s. The Shadefolk on the other hand were very secretive. Almost every warrior was ordered not to go into contact with other species for unknown reasons, so they just made their camp and pursued as introverts. The Centipedras were also very strict about their isolation policies. Given most their species were very pretty females, they have to keep a constant eye out of anything kind of bad behavior from others, but they were not in complete solitude as the queen let them roam in groups. The Crystals were all over the place, their leader let them roam free and told them to be themselves without causing harm or uncomfortable behavior. Some groups were silly and unattached, while others tried to find other species who had the same hobbies as they do. The Frosts were undergoing training regimens while also subbing out groups to go meet with all the species. If there was anybody that was the most organized and respectful about other species, it was them. The meeting event lasted only about 8 hours before the truce was going to commence. 
</br>

</br>
A lot of commotion was occuring throughout all the species camps, but nothing to a major point of trouble. Now we finally reach the truce, where all species reported back to their camps, and all leaders would step forward. Six sets of stairs were built around the podium in the center, each leader walked up a set of stairs. Different things were going through each of their heads as a huge moment was upon them all. The leaders all reached the top, where the deed sat in the center of the podium, waiting to be signed. One at a time, a leader would give their speech, their nation would rally, and they would sign it, but there was a slight pause when it came to the Shadefolk leader. Just as the Shadefolk leader was about ready to sign it, disaster struck at that very moment.
</br>

</br>
Purple clouds formed out of the sky, causing uncanny emotions throughout the continent. At first it left everyone confused, purple clouds were never seen before, and it did not look good. The cloud started channeling electricity through it and then it happened. A huge pink lighting bolt struck the front part of the Shadefolk kingdom as hard as it could. The King: Yaozen was in shambles. Quickly after the strike on the Shadefolk Kingdom, an individual strike of the same capacity struck all of other kingdoms in a circle starting with Reptilians and making its way around, as one was about to hit the Crystals Kingdom though, the heart of the kingdom deflected it and instead, it hit the Zuku’s extra hard, leaving it completely in shambles.
</br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/aEHnNYH.png" width="725" height="455" alt="Your Image">
</br>
But Yaozen still stood there with his claymore loose in his hand, eyes wide, he never thought he would see his kingdom crumble so fast. The fears he had developed through his entire life as King have become a reality, and he couldn’t control his emotions anymore. The one thing he sought to protect and improve was blasted away in an instant, it was something he could not stand for. It would then be at this moment that a war was declared, The Dark Skies War.
</br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/e6kK3Lr.png" width="725" height="455" alt="Your Image">
</br>
Yaozen would immediately place the blame on the Crystals. It was the only logical reason for him since their kingdom seemed immune to the effects of the lightning. So, with that intense thought of anger, he shouted “ALL TROOPS, SEIZE THE DAMNED WHO CAUSED THIS MADNESS, THE CRYSTALS LIVES END HERE!” moments after it was shouted, all hell broke loose. After Shadefolk warriors pushed and shoved through the Centipedras they immediately charged at the Crystals with matched anger of the king. The other species were left speechless but wouldn’t stand by and let this happen. Yaozen was a masterful tactician though, as he had more men ready to fight then every species combined. If anyone was ready for a war it was him. Shadefolk warriors in different quadrants were sent to seize each kingdom and prevent them from interfering with the siege on the Crystals. Yaozen knew others wouldn’t let him pursue his goals, so with the understanding that there is no going back, he took two steps forward instead.
</br>

</br>
The wars duration was immense, it started at the center of the continent and eventually traced back to each species home kingdoms, where Shadefolk were just flooding from everywhere with new advanced weapons beyond any other species comprehension. It was a war of madness and uncertainty. Results soon came in though, as after a single year, the Reptilians put an end to the Shadefolk’s siege on them and emerged somewhat victorious. After 2 years, The Frosts and Centipedras on the other hand faced different ends as they ended up under an agreement of surrender that favored the Shadefolk immensely. The ends of the Zuku’s were quickly met in under a week, no Zuku seemed to make it out alive. Finally for the Crystals, the surprise attack severely hurt their numbers, so their only instinct was to head for the ocean, where they can breathe under water, and no one else can. They retreated successfully with a little more than half their species alive. This endeavor is not one to forget for ages to come.

</br>
Time passed after the seeming end of the war, each species had a chance to regrow, but this time, they did it in solitude. Everyone was so traumatized from the aftermaths that they just didn’t want to deal with anyone with all the chaos that just happend. So, trade was quickly cut off, but evolution of the species didn’t stop. With this, there was no chnace of the species leaving their respective kingdom area, even some policies of some of the kingdoms called it treason if you step outside of kingdom borders. It was an unfortunate event that got cast upon everyone, what was worse is that there was something new brewing. Because about 3 years after the wars end, unforeseen Monsters started appearing randomly, no one could make out what kind of species they were. Naturally the monsters were fended off in each remaining kingdom, except for the Centipedra kingdom, where every one of the Centipedras was forced underground because of the pure mass and strength of the monsters there was unlike any other for some reason. No one dared to question it assuming it was just nature, but something far worse was going to happen. As for the Crystals, 10 years after the wars end they fought their way back to their land and started their life again, completely renovating their home one step at a time and staying positive during the process. But as the years passed since the end of the dark war, Yaozen has been planning his next strike very carefully, from designing new weapons to delving into potion study’s and war machines, because this time, he wasn’t going to let any of the species live peacefully.

    <h1>Species</h1>
    <p> Species are the types of weird creatures found in The Adventures Of Crizion, this is to help people get a better understanding of the species and their habits.
</br>
<p style="color: green;">Reptilian's</p> These are anthropomorphic alligators/crocodiles. The species has not always been the brightest. They tend to use brute force for everything. All in all, they just want to have a good time usually.
</br>
<p style="color: brown;">Zuku's</p> These are people who are trees, skin as bark and such. The species is known for being the Oldest to inhabit the land, known more as a peaceful tribe that just wants to live life on their land.
</br>
<p style="color: purple;">Shadefolk's</p> These are one of the closest species to humans, except their skin is completely pitch black and more sensitive to damage. Like I said, they are the closest to humans, so they have a progressively high evolution rate, being the most advanced of all the species.
</br>
<p style="color: orange;">Centipedra's</p> These are also another close match to humans, except with bug like features and ripe orange skin. The population consists mostly of females opposed to males because of simple nature, they are mostly smart while at the same time harsh with their way of life.
</br>
<p style="color: pink;">Crystal's</p> These are creatures that are made of crystals with a resembling structure of multiple kinds of sea life. These are a freelance species with not many laws and has the most freedom out of any species, everyone gets to express their own interests and desires freely as long as it does not do harm.
</br>
<p style="color: lightblue;">Frost's</p> This is the final close match to humans; they just have blue skin and consider cold temperatures to feel good while extremely hot ones hurt them. Their species also had a regular human-like evolution, they like to build marvelous structures and expand their culture far and wide.
</br>
</br>
Other species are coming soon!

        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Crazytree (also known by Fern) is a clueless Zuku that never knows what’s going on. Once he is fixated on something, he will stop paying attention to anything else, but he is also loyal to the very end when it comes to friendships. Crazytree was born about a year before the Dark Skies wars beginning, as he grew up, He was an insane kid that didn’t think too much about his choices, he did what he pleased. So instead of calling him by his real name Fern, everyone nicknamed him Crazytree. His father, who was the King of the Kingdom, had a pent-up rage from Crazytrees actions as they got worse. Soon he couldn’t take it anymore, since lecturing had no effect, he struck Crazytree. After being struck, Crazytree was put in a state of mind where he did nothing, people thought he was paralyzed and mentally damaged and the King regretted his action the most. Time passed and eventually The Dark Skies war came, the Zuku's entire kingdom was up in flames, The King quickly grabbed Crazytree from his seated spot and ran to a secret safety chamber while Arrowite fended off Shadefolk soldiers. The chamber could only hold one person, but was immune to almost anything, it was reserved for the king. But instead, The King shoved Crazytree in there along with the powerful gem from his staff, the chamber was sealed off and the king went up in flames. After a long slumber that caused him to become mute in the process, he was released by no other than Crizion himself, to which he gave his utmost loyalty to Crizion. Crazytree try’s his best to tend to peaceful tactics, but knows that violence must sometimes be an option with his great power he has. His dream is to restore peace to the world with his buddy Crizion.</p>

With his super fast speed and reflexes, he can do whatever he pleases, he always steals the show with his massive amounts of jesting. Bulletblade was born into a family of absolute royalty, he is the youngest of the 3 brothers in the royal family. His father; Yaozen, sought a son who could carry the vessel of a dragon. Yaozen got what he wanted instantly as the eldest brother Wuji was gifted it, so Reiss and Garvoch were casted aside and paid no attention too. The dark skies war took place, but Bulletblade was safe inside the castle with the strongest defense, so he went uneffected. As time passed from their, he took on the job of a guard. One day, he chased a theif into a valley who had stolen fruits, once he reached the end of the valley is where eveyrhting changed for him. He saw hundreds of Shadefolk, starving and with ripped clothes. That was all Reiss needed to see to realize how cruel his fathers methods were. That same day, he confronted his father about it and they ended up getting into a huge argument, something Reiss said to Yaozen really struck Yaozens ego, so Yaozen swung his claymore and Reiss and banished him from the Royal doors. From their, Reiss traveled back to the Valley with the unfortanute in it and offered help, their cheif accepted them. From there, Reiss became an astonishing theif, honing his skills to perfection to steal all kinds of neccesities without anyone batting an eye. Eventully he was caught on too though and a bounty was put on his head. But that didnt stop him, the cheif of the unfortanate gifted Reiss with a fancy cloth that resembled a ninja suit and two katanas, shortly after, Benton gifted him with two pistols crafted by him for helping his family in the unfortanate. Reiss then decided to go by the nickname of Bulletblade, and he swore to fight for the unfortanate, since thats what he wants to do. Bulletblades dream is to correct the mistakes his father made...and to pick up a hot chick to marry along the way.</p>

After the war, she was given an education, where she quickly rose to the top. As time continued, she was still the top of her class, making the other girls jealous, she got dared to go to the surface of the desert, where monsters roamed. With all the pressure that was laid on to her, she did it. After quickly making it to the surface, it wasn’t long before she was spotted. Thinking she could go back down; she wasn’t able to do too since she drilled improperly. She was about an inch before becoming lunch meat until the monster swerved to its side and dropped to the ground. Izzy looked around for a moment and saw another figure, centipedra shaped with black skin. Both of them quickly went back underground. The centipedra who killed the monster was Lisa, after asking Izzy a few questions, she asked where her parents were. It wasn’t long until Lisa realized she was an orphan. After some time, Lisa made the heartfelt decision to adopt Izzy. From there, Izzy learned the ways of the hunter and worked on her own personal skills for the rest of her years up until now.

        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Tkaragem is a hard-working competitive crystal that treats everything as if it were a testament to his skill. He will do anything to become the greatest, all while gaining respect from his peers. Tkaragem was born Shortly after the Crystals general awakening from the grand heart. From there, his self-proclaimed leader, Ukara, guided him along with everyone else on a path to find themselves in the world. Tkaragem mostly took interest in competition, he would do simple things like racing others and having hand to hand duals with others. Tkaragem didn’t make many friends this way, but he didn’t care, all he cared about was being the best. Ukara let him explore that interest for a while until almost two years passed, when Ukara would have an important talk with Tkaragem. After the talk led to the events of the Dark Skies war. Since the siege was almost immediate for the crystals with the blame placed on them. Tkaragem and all the other Crystals were caught off guard. Tkaragem was practicing his combat only to suddenly be ambushed by a Shadefolk. Tkaragem was able to handle him with ease, but it didn’t come so easy when he was surrounded. Ukara would then jump in to save the day, using specialized sleep dart crystals from his tail to put them to sleep. Ukara was against the thought of unnatural killing, they believed that this was not an unnatural scenario. Everyone was set to run for the ocean, since they could breathe in water. As Ukara and Tkaragem were about to reach the edge, Tkaragem wasn’t ready to flee, he got out of Ukaras grasp and started beating up more Shadefolk. Ukara stopped him shortly and attempted to pull him. Shortly after, Ukara got impaled. The moment was silent and Tkaragem was shell shocked. Someone else picked up Tkaragem and they went deep into the ocean. Tkaragem then spent the first few years of his life mourning until he was hit with a vision from Ukara. After that, Tkaragem stayed true to his goals while helping others as well. After a few more years, the crystals would take back their land from the Shadefolk and life would begin anew. Tkaragem now continues to support everyone’s paths, showing signs of compassion despite not showing emotions super well. Tkaragem’s dream is to become the best combat warrior there ever was and to find someone worthy of his strength.</p>

	<p><strong>Species:</strong> Frost</p>
        <p><strong>Gender:</strong> Female♀️</p>
        <p><strong>Age:</strong> 18</p>
	<p><strong>Role:</strong> Hero</p>
        <p><strong>Birthday:</strong> August 30th</p>
        <hr>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Anya is a stone-cold law-abiding warrior that will stop at nothing to bring people to justice. She will spend all day perfecting her skills to defend her nation until the day she dies, no matter what. Anya was born very shortly before the dark skies war. She was born into a family of high regards, one where her father was a general of the frost army. When the dark skies war hit, Anya's father came back gravely injured, with one leg completely broken and an arm gravely injured. Something rattled inside Anya's brain, despite being only a baby, it would be an image she never forgets. The image of her injured father would keep reappearing in her head like a mental nightmare, she couldn’t stand to see her father in that state or worse, dead. As Anya grew up, she paid no attention to academics and focused only on combat training. Her designated weapon was a short sword, where she would use it at least 5 hours a day. As she kept growing up, her combat and physique kept improving, but her social skills and family bonds slowly grew apart. Anya would not even bother to make friends in school, any attempt from someone would be shunned, and boys who hit on her would end up with their head in the ground. Her family was concerned about her intense training engagement. At 16, an argument sparked between Anya's family and Anya. Her father got mad enough to the point where he called her a monster. Anya ended that conversation with a slammed door. She made her way to the frontline winter storms of the Frosts land and set up her own bootcamp. This is where she would spend the next 2 years. She has fought off a formidable number of people, even the cruel monster known as Ludicrous, with every new victory, she feels a little of herself dying inside and wonders how life could be different. Anya's dream is to protect her homeland and bring anyone to justice that tries to harm it, and to finally make her father see that she was right.</p>

        <hr>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Axol is cautious and easily frightened Dragon who loves to make all kinds of melee weaponry. While he cowers in the face of battle, he is highly skilled in making unique and never breaking weapons. Axol was born in the Revendead continent, specifically the Death Valley, which is where he gets his dark red color from. In a place like Death Valley, murder, weapons and fights were everything. Axol was raised to inherit his father’s fighting legacy, but he didn’t want that, Axol was scared of fights, therefore, he ended up getting kicked out of his household at age 15. He then discovered his love for designing weapons. Swords specifically was what he loved to do, any shape or size, Axol was able to do it. Axol then started a business for weapon making and became a great hit, everyone in his local neighborhood would buy weapons from him. The business was going well, until it attracted his fathers attention along with their current monarch. The monarch did not support the freestyle selling of weapons, furious, he challenged Axol to a fight. Just as the monarch was about to blow Axol’s head off, his father stepped in and vowed to fight for him. Axol was confused, but he couldn’t think straight, in the presence of the monarch Axol was coveted in fear. With only a signaling nod from Axol’s father, Axol fled Death Valley, and didn’t look back. After flying for what seemed to be forever, he stumbled upon the Fraier Continent. He then continued to start up and run his business for the next few years. While he is proud of what he has accomplished, Axol’s new dream is to find a way to travel back to Revendead a new and brave dragon to make his father proud.</p>

	<p><strong>Role:</strong> Hero</p>
        <p><strong>Birthday:</strong> April 1st</p>
        <hr>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Pelestia is a kind and heart-warming Guardian who looks over the lands of Fraier as the seemingly last of her species. She is always looking for someone to tend to, she strives to heal people who do good for the world and to make a difference. Pelestia was born amongst the sky’s in the clouds as a part of an ancient species: The Guardians. They had marvelous civilizations that would cycle the outer parts of the Fraier Continent, and no other species knew of their existance. Pelestia was born amongst them. All of her life, she was raised to be a magnificent wound healer, being taught among the best, where there was no room for mistakes. She spent most of her life indoors, unable to use her perfectly good wings to explore the world. While sadden, she embraced her teachings and didn’t question any higher ups. But it wasn’t all bad for her, she made many friends through the path of healing, she didn’t mind not being able to leave at all. But then, The Dark Skies War occurred. With the clouds plagued purple and crackling electricity flowing through them all, it caused a huge electric chain reaction to the entirety of the kingdom. This caused every guardian there to get electrocuted, causing their bodies to evaporate from the span and range of the purple clouds power. After the month that the clouds were purple, they slowly turned grey with time, and the electricity was at a normal pace again at least. Pelestia was the only survivor, she didn’t know how, but she knew that she got blinded from the experience, she would never see again. Because she didn’t know what happened, she thought that everyone had fled from the lightning-fast attack. So, she started to feel her way around the kingdom again to look for any signs of life, but none were there. Her dream is to simply wait for them to come back so she could be together with them again…A dream that will never come true.</p>
